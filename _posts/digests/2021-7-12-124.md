### Mini Briefs

#### [Maine Now Has the Toughest Facial Recognition Restrictions in the U.S.](https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/maine-facial-recognition-government-use-law.html)

As debate over the merits and risks of facial recognition technology continues, Maine's House and Senate unanimously approved LD 1585 on June 16 and 17. LD 1585 is only the second statewide law to regulate facial recognition, but stands out as the nation's toughest law on the matter. Championed by the ACLU, Maine's legislation takes a key step beyond its predecessors by prohibiting use of facial recognition across _all_ levels of state, county, and municipal government. The law outlines strict parameters for exceptions made for law enforcement purposes, and stipulates that facial recognition data cannot be used alone to establish probable cause for an arrest.

#### [How TikTok's hate speech detection tool set off a debate about racial bias on the app](https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/7/7/22566017/tiktok-black-creators-ziggi-tyler-debate-about-black-lives-matter-racial-bias-social-media)

Just as Facebook and Twitter have made efforts to wrangle hate speech on their platforms, so has the upstart social platform Tiktok. But Tiktok's hate speech detector seems to suffer from an error: when Tiktok users typed phrases about Black content in their bios, such as "Black success" or "Black Lives Matter," Tiktok flagged those users' content as "inappropriate." If those users replaced those phrases with "white supremacy" or "white success," they received no warning. As a result, many Black creators have been protesting Tiktok because they feel unrecognized and underserved by the platform, falling into a larger trend of how their content is moderated on social media. A Tiktok spokesperson said the platform is actively working to resolve this issue.
