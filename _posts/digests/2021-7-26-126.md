#### [Alphabet launches new robotics software company Intrinsic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/alphabet-intrinsic-robotics-software-company.html)

Google's parent company Alphabet launched a new robotics software company called Intrinsic.
This is an offshoot of a project group under X, Google's moonshot project division.
The Intrinsic team has been around for 5 years, and with this public launch the company aims to bring AI-enabled robot arms to manufacturing tasks.
Intrinsic showed off video demos of a robot assembling plug-and-play furniture and inserting USB cables.
It remains to be seen what specific tasks the company will tackle and commercialize.

#### [Is GitHub Copilot a blessing, or a curse?](https://www.fast.ai/2021/07/19/copilot/)

Among the auxiliary models to follow OpenAI's GPT-3 has ben GitHub CoPilot. 
The new service aims to be an AI-enabled "pair programmer," that can ostensibly understand the code you intend to write, using context like docstrings, and write a significant amount of that code itself. 
In a blog post, fast.ai founder Jeremy Howard gives a demo of Copilot and explains some of its issues. 
In particular, while Copilot is an achievement in creating reasonable-looking code, its output is code "that doesn’t work, doesn’t check edge cases, and uses obsolete methods, and is verbose and creates technical debt." 
Copilot could be useful in a limited number of situations, but an over-reliance on its code-generation capabilities, coupled with automation bias, could be a detriment for less experienced programmers in particular.

#### [Something Bothering You? Tell It to Woebot.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/health/artificial-intelligence-therapy-woebot.html)

Woebot is an app that acts as a simple AI-based ‘automated therapist’ to help users improve their mental health, with a focus on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) based techinques. 
It was founded in 2016 by psychologist and healthcare designer Alison Darcy after she was a post-doctoral researcher fellow and instructor at the Stanford University School of Medicine. 
With the COVID pandemic having greatly increased the demand for mental health services, it is among seen a large amount of growth in the past year; the number of its daily users doubled and is now in the tens of thousands. 
Other similar automated therapists exists, and Woebot differentiates itself by being heavily based on clinical research that demonstrate the benefits of CBT therapy. 
The company states that its intent is not to replace human therapists, but rather provide additional support that can complement the help of human therapists.
