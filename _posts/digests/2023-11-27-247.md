#### [Stability AI debuts Stable Video Diffusion models in research preview](https://venturebeat.com/ai/stability-ai-debuts-stable-video-diffusion-models-in-research-preview/)
![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/DALL·E-2023-10-25-10.29.08-Photo-of-a-person-of-Hispanic-descent-in-a-relaxed-pose-having-a-video-conference-with-an-advanced-looking-robot.-The-laptop-from-which-the-call-is-m-e1700766229577.png?w=1200&strip=all)

Stability AI has released Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), a set of AI models for generating short video clips from still images. The models, SVD and SVD-XT, produce high-quality outputs and have been open-sourced for research purposes. The models take in a still image as a conditioning frame and generate 576 x 1024 videos, lasting up to four seconds. Stability AI plans to refine the models based on user feedback and eventually introduce new features for commercial applications. The models have been evaluated to have high quality outputs but still have limitations, such as missing photorealism and generating videos without motion or faces. The code and weights for the models are available on Stability AI's GitHub repository and Hugging Face page.

#### [Underage Workers Are Training AI](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-data-labeling-children/)
![](https://media.wired.com/photos/65540f07b2396fab4b076472/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Underage-Workers-Are-Training-AI-Business.jpg)

This article discusses the involvement of underage workers in training artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. The process of training AI algorithms involves labeling and verifying data, which is often outsourced to gig workers. These workers, including minors, are responsible for tasks ranging from simple image identification to complex content moderation. The article highlights the case of a 15-year-old worker from Pakistan who joined an online platform and bypassed age verification checks. The practice of underage workers in AI training is found to be widespread, with evidence from workers in Kenya as well. The article sheds light on the hidden human labor behind AI and raises concerns about the exploitation of underage workers in this industry.
