#### [How AI's full power can accelerate the fight against climate change](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/time-to-utilise-the-full-power-of-ai-to-accelerate-our-fight-against-climate-change-301cb3f9d4/)

A new report by the UN details three ways that AI can be used to help combat climate change.
One - AI help measure and reduce emissions for companies.
This is done by using data-driven methods for simulation and forecasts, real-time decision making on electricity usage, and making carbon-intensive industrial operations more efficient
Two - AI can enable new business models that directly tackle climate change.
Most of this is related to carbon sequestration companies, whom AI can help by identifying best-suited lands for carbon storage, perform large-scale carbon measurement in soil, and make relevant predictions from satellite images.
Lastly, AI can make climate-related disaster response more effective by identifying areas more vulnerable to flooding and fires with large lead times and high accuracy.

#### [The prominent Facebook AI researcher at the center of its misinformation scandals has quietly left the company](https://www.businessinsider.com/joaquin-quionero-candela-has-left-facebook-responsible-ai-team-2021-9)

Months ago. Technology Review's Karen Hao interviewed Facebook AI researcher Joaquin Quiñonero Candela. 
Hao found that, as Facebook's Head of Responsible AI, Candela had been forced into an impossible position of fixing Facebook's AI systems after building many of them. 
On September 13, he announced on his LinkedIn profile and the Partnership on AI website that he had left the company. 
In his decade-long tenure at the company, Candela began by working on advertising optimization with machine learning and was critical in building Facebook's machine learning pipeline. 
He had direct access to Mark Zuckerberg, who relied heavily on his expertise in arranging Facebook's response to misinformation on the platform.

#### [These weird, unsettling photos show that AI is getting smarter](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/25/1008921/ai-allen-institute-generates-images-from-captions/)

Researchers at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, AI2, have developed a new text-and-image model that can generate images given a caption. 
Although the images are far from realistic and are even a bit unsettling, they do showcase the potential for huge AI advances to come in the coming years.
While there has been a lot of work on generic photorealistic images, the new work tackles the more complex task of producing an image given a text description of it. 
Going beyond single-modality models that only deal with text or images to models that can produce images from text would be a major advance for AI and enable many important applications.
