#### [Imbue raises $200M to build AI models that can ‚Äòrobustly reason‚Äô](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/07/imbue-raises-200m-to-build-ai-models-that-can-robustly-reason/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/GettyImages-1448152453.jpg?resize=1200,675)

AI research lab Imbue, formerly known as Generally Intelligent, has secured $200 million in a Series B funding round, bringing its total funding to $220 million and valuing the company at over $1 billion. The funding will be used to accelerate the development of AI systems that can reason and code, with the ultimate goal of creating practical AI agents that can work safely in the real world. Imbue's approach involves designing AI models that can solve tasks in complex 3D worlds, with a recent shift towards developing models that can code. The company believes that robust reasoning is crucial for effective AI agents and that code can improve reasoning and is an effective way for models to take actions on a machine. Imbue is also investing in its own AI and machine learning tooling and conducting research into understanding the learning process in large language models.


#### [Ads for AI sex workers are flooding Instagram and TikTok](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/ai-girlfriend-ads-instagram-tiktok-chat-pics-chatgpt-dose-rcna97547)
![](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-08/230807-meta-ai-porn-lr-72a74d.jpg)

Sexually explicit advertisements for AI chatbots have been proliferating on social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, despite these platforms' strict policies against sexualized content. The ads, run by dozens of tech startups, promote not-safe-for-work experiences with AI-generated characters, often using popular children's TV characters or anime-style images. NBC News found 35 app developers running such ads on Meta-owned platforms and 14 on TikTok. The rise of these ads is part of a larger trend to capitalize on the growing interest in AI, following the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT product. Critics argue that these ads reflect a double standard, as real human sex workers are not allowed to monetize their images on these platforms. Both Meta and TikTok have begun removing these ads after being contacted by NBC News, but questions remain about how they bypassed the platforms' filters in the first place.


#### [Anthropic‚Äôs Claude AI chatbot gets a paid plan for heavy users](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23862848/anthropic-claude-pro-ai-chatbot-paid-plan-google)

Anthropic, an AI firm supported by Google, has introduced a paid version of its Claude chatbot for heavy users in the US and UK. The Claude Pro plan, priced at $20 or ¬£18 per month, provides priority access during peak times, early access to new features, and the ability to send more messages. The key advantage of this plan is that it allows five times more usage than the free tier, enabling users to send more messages in less time. The company promises a minimum of 100 messages every eight hours based on Claude's capacity, with a warning system in place when only 10 messages are left, and a reset every eight hours.
