#### [NYC’s anti-bias law for hiring algorithms goes into effect](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/nycs-anti-bias-law-for-hiring-algorithms-goes-into-effect/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GettyImages-1254738673.jpg?resize=1200,800)

New York City has begun enforcing a new law that requires employers using algorithms for recruitment, hiring, or promotion to submit those algorithms for an independent audit and make the results public. The law also mandates that companies using these algorithms disclose information to employees or job candidates. The reports that companies must make public must include the algorithms being used, as well as an "average score" candidates of different races, ethnicities, and genders are likely to receive from the algorithms. Companies found not to be in compliance will face penalties. The law applies to anyone performing or applying for a job in the city. The legislation is seen as necessary to address the potential biases that can be amplified by recruitment AI algorithms. The article highlights previous instances of bias in hiring algorithms and the growing adoption of AI in hiring processes. The article also mentions efforts by the industry to self-regulate and the potential impact of the law on future legislation in other jurisdictions. The key takeaway is that New York City's anti-bias law for hiring algorithms is the first of its kind in the country and aims to increase transparency and accountability in the use of AI in hiring processes.

#### [EU and Japan look to partner on A.I. and chips as China 'de-risking' strategy continues](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/03/eu-japan-look-to-partner-on-ai-chips-amid-china-de-risking-push.html)

The European Union (EU) is seeking closer cooperation with Japan in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI) and chips, as it aims to reduce its reliance on China. EU Commissioner Thierry Breton is meeting with the Japanese government to discuss organizing the digital space and establishing an EU-Japan Digital Partnership council. The EU is also looking to cooperate with Japan in the semiconductor industry, as Japan is a key player in the semiconductor supply chain. This partnership with Japan is part of the EU's strategy to "de-risk" from China and strengthen its own technology industry.

#### [OpenAI's ChatGPT Shows a Significant Slowing in Traffic](https://aisupremacy.substack.com/p/openais-chatgpt-shows-a-significant)
![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38ee5a9c-1492-4aa9-ab25-3503113b8894_847x528.png)

According to a note from Bank of America (BofA) analysts, app downloads for ChatGPT, the Microsoft-backed startup, have significantly slowed down. Sensor Tower data revealed a 38% month-over-month decrease in ChatGPT app downloads on iPhones in the United States in June. The same note also mentioned a 38% decline in Bing app downloads, which incorporates a ChatGPT-based chatbot. In contrast, Google's search engine market share has slightly increased to over 92%, while Microsoft's Bing dropped to about 2.8% of the market. This decline in ChatGPT's popularity suggests that the initial viral adoption claimed by OpenAI in the first six months may be fading, possibly due to increased awareness of the risks associated with the technology and more companies banning its use. The article highlights the investment risk for a stock market that has been overly optimistic about nascent AI technology, with some labeling it as a bubble.
