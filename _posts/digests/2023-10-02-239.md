#### [Mistral AI makes its first large language model free for everyone](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/mistral-ai-makes-its-first-large-language-model-free-for-everyone/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/mistral-7b-v0.1.jpg?resize=1200,610)

French AI startup, Mistral, has released its first large language model, Mistral 7B, for free use without restrictions under the Apache 2.0 license. The model, which the company claims outperforms others of its size, is available for download via various means, including a 13.4-gigabyte torrent. Mistral 7B is a refined version of other "small" large language models, offering similar capabilities at a significantly lower compute cost. The company has also started a GitHub repository and Discord channel for collaboration and troubleshooting. While the model is free to use, it is not open source as it was developed privately with private funds, and the datasets and weights are also private. Mistral's business model appears to be offering the free model for use, but charging for their commercial offering, which includes both weights and code sources.

#### [Hollywood‚Äôs Deal With Screenwriters Just Rewrote the Rules Around A.I.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/29/opinion/wga-strike-deal-ai-jobs.html)

The Writers Guild of America (W.G.A.) has negotiated a deal with Hollywood studios regarding the use of AI in scriptwriting. The agreement ensures that AI cannot replace credited and paid guild members, although it can be used to generate first drafts. The credited writers will receive the same minimum pay as if they had written the piece from scratch. The deal also addresses copyright concerns, as material generated by AI cannot be copyrighted. The W.G.A.'s approach mirrors successful labor negotiation tactics from the past, such as the International Longshore and Warehouse Union's acceptance of port containerization in 1960, which resulted in wage and job guarantees for most workers and benefits for those displaced.

#### [Franzen, Grisham and Other Prominent Authors Sue OpenAI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/books/authors-openai-lawsuit-chatgpt-copyright.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/09/21/books/19AIlawsuit-print/19AIlawsuit-1-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Prominent authors including Jonathan Franzen, John Grisham, David Baldacci, Jodi Picoult, George R.R. Martin, George Saunders, and Michael Connelly have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, represented by the Authors Guild. The lawsuit is in response to ChatGPT's ability to generate detailed information about their books, beyond what is publicly available, as demonstrated by novelist Douglas Preston's interaction with ChatGPT. Since its introduction in November, ChatGPT has been a point of contention in the publishing industry, with a surge in AI-generated books appearing on Amazon. In response, Amazon has implemented new guidelines for self-published authors, requiring them to disclose AI usage in text creation and limiting the number of titles they can upload daily.

#### [Top GOP senator teams up with key Dem on ‚Äòlight-touch‚Äô AI bill](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/20/thune-klobuchar-ai-bill-00117236)
![](https://static.politico.com/b3/60/547eb5594b94a4781f0f814a8926/u-s-senate-38356.jpg)

Top GOP senator, Thune, and key Democrat, Klobuchar, are collaborating on a 'light-touch' AI bill aimed at mitigating the risks of AI applications while avoiding heavy regulation. The bill, which has not yet been officially introduced, has already gained support from influential figures such as Ryan Hagemann, AI policy executive at IBM. The proposed legislation would task the Commerce Department with enforcement, but companies developing or deploying AI systems would be responsible for assessing their impact and certifying their safety. The bill is expected to gain more Senate cosponsors ahead of its official introduction, which is anticipated to occur within the next week or two.
