#### [Biden Issues Executive Order to Create A.I. Safeguards](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/us/politics/biden-ai-regulation.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/30/multimedia/30dc-biden-lhbw/30dc-biden-lhbw-facebookJumbo.jpg)

President Biden has signed an executive order on artificial intelligence (AI) that requires companies to report to the federal government about the risks their systems pose in aiding countries or terrorists in creating weapons of mass destruction. The order also aims to address the dangers of "deep fakes" that can manipulate audio and video to spread fake news, commit fraud, or smear reputations. Biden expressed concern about the potential for fraudsters to manipulate a person's voice and create a viral statement that never happened, leading to political or national security crises. The order demonstrates the US's commitment to leading in AI regulation, as Europe is already moving forward with its own rules. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the US at an international conference on AI regulation in Britain.

#### [ChatGPT is combining its different abilities into a single ‚ÄòVoltron-style‚Äô chat](https://venturebeat.com/ai/chatgpt-is-combining-its-different-abilities-into-a-single-voltron-style-chat/)

OpenAI has released an update to its AI chatbot, ChatGPT, that combines multiple capabilities into a single chat session. Previously, users had to toggle each capability independently, but now they can analyze and answer questions about documents, browse the web, perform data analysis, and generate images using OpenAI's DALL-E model all within the same session. This update improves the efficiency of the service and has been well-received by users. However, some have raised security concerns about the combination of browsing and code interpretation capabilities, as it could potentially be exploited for malicious purposes. OpenAI has not yet formally announced the update.

#### [Elon Musk debuts 'Grok' AI bot to rival ChatGPT, others](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/05/elon-musk-debuts-grok-ai-bot-to-rival-chatgpt-others-.html)

Elon Musk has unveiled Grok, an AI bot developed by his new company xAI. Grok is designed to answer "spicy questions" and has a rebellious and witty personality. It has access to data from X, giving it an advantage over other AI models. However, xAI acknowledges that Grok can still generate false or contradictory information. The prototype is currently in beta testing and will eventually be available as a feature of X Premium+. In initial tests, Grok outperformed other models in its compute class but was surpassed by bots with larger data sets. The goal of xAI is to build AI that advances our collective understanding of the universe and is accessible to people of all backgrounds and political views.

#### [At UK's AI Summit developers and govts agree on testing to help manage risks](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-pm-sunak-lead-ai-summit-talks-before-musk-meeting-2023-11-02/)

Leading AI developers and governments have agreed to collaborate on testing new AI models before their release to manage the risks associated with the technology. The agreement was reached at the UK's artificial intelligence summit, where political leaders from the US, EU, and China signed a declaration to share a common approach to identifying and mitigating risks. The summit also saw the establishment of an international panel on risk and the delivery of a "State of the Science" report by AI expert Yoshua Bengio. The aim is to rigorously assess AI models before and after deployment to ensure safety. The summit brought together politicians, academics, and tech executives to discuss the future of AI and establish global oversight.
