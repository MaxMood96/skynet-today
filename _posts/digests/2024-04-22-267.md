#### [AI Flew X-62 VISTA During Simulated Dogfight Against Manned F-16](https://theaviationist.com/2024/04/18/ai-flew-x-62-vista-during-dogfight/)
![](https://theaviationist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/X-62_VISTA_AI_Dogfight_1.jpg)

The U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have successfully flown the X-62 VISTA, an aircraft controlled by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent, in a simulated dogfight against a human-piloted F-16. This breakthrough, part of DARPA’s Air Combat Evolution (ACE) program, took place in the airspace above Edwards Air Force Base, California, with the AI successfully conducting over 100,000 lines of flight-critical software changes across 21 test flights. The X-62A was flown with safety pilots onboard who had the ability to disengage the AI agent if necessary, but this was not required during the tests. This achievement marks a significant step in the use of AI in flight-critical systems, with potential applications in both commercial and defense aerospace sectors.


#### [Intel Builds World’s Largest Neuromorphic System to Enable More Sustainable AI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-builds-worlds-largest-neuromorphic-system.html#gs.8ahyp2)
![](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/central-libraries/us/en/images/2024-04/newsroom-intel-hala-point-owl.jpg)

Intel has developed Hala Point, the world's largest neuromorphic system, capable of supporting up to 20 quadrillion operations per second with an efficiency exceeding 15 trillion 8-bit operations per second per watt. This system outperforms architectures built on graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs), and is expected to enable real-time continuous learning for AI applications in various fields, including scientific and engineering problem-solving, logistics, smart city infrastructure management, and large language models (LLMs). Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories plan to use Hala Point for advanced brain-scale computing research, focusing on scientific computing problems in device physics, computer architecture, computer science, and informatics. The development of Hala Point is significant due to the increasing need for sustainable AI solutions, as the scaling up of deep learning models has exposed sustainability challenges in AI, necessitating innovation in hardware architecture.


#### [Meta releases Llama 3, claims it’s among the best open models available](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/18/meta-releases-llama-3-claims-its-among-the-best-open-models-available/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/meta-brands-glitch.jpg?resize=1200,675)

Meta has launched two new models in its Llama 3 series of open generative AI models, Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B, which contain 8 billion and 70 billion parameters respectively. The company claims these models, trained on two custom-built 24,000 GPU clusters, are among the best-performing generative AI models available today. The Llama 3 models have outperformed other models such as Mistral’s Mistral 7B and Google’s Gemma 7B on at least nine benchmarks. The larger Llama 3 model, Llama 3 70B, is also competitive with flagship generative AI models, including Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro. Meta also claims that the new Llama models offer more "steerability," a lower likelihood to refuse to answer questions, and higher accuracy on trivia questions, questions pertaining to history and STEM fields such as engineering and science and general coding recommendations, thanks to a much larger dataset of 15 trillion tokens.


#### [Boston Dynamics’ Robert Playter on the New Atlas](https://spectrum.ieee.org/atlas-humanoid-robot-ceo-interview)
![](https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/photo-montage-of-two-humanoid-robots-flanking-a-headshot-of-a-man-with-glasses-and-a-goatee.jpg?id=52019964&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C125%2C0%2C125)

The article discusses Boston Dynamics' new Atlas, as explained by Robert Playter, with the piece written by Evan Ackerman, a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum. Ackerman, who has written over 6,000 articles on robotics and technology since 2007, provides an in-depth look at the new Atlas. His background in Martian geology and proficiency in playing bagpipes add a unique perspective to his analysis. The article primarily focuses on the technical details and advancements of the new Atlas robot from Boston Dynamics.
