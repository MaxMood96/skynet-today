Google's latest AI model, Gemini-Exp-1114, has topped the Imarena Chatbot Arena leaderboard, surpassing OpenAI's GPT-4o and o1-preview reasoning models. The leaderboard, previously known as the LMSys arena, allows AI labs to compete their models in a blind head-to-head competition, with users voting without knowledge of which model is which. The Gemini-Exp-1114 model, developed by Google DeepMind, excels particularly in math and vision tasks. Despite its success, the model is not yet available on the Gemini app or website, and can only be accessed through a free Google AI Studio account. The model's performance in technical and creative areas suggests it may be useful for reasoning and managing agents.

French startup Mistral has launched Pixtral Large, a 124-billion-parameter model, and upgraded its chatbot, Le Chat, to compete directly with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Pixtral Large, an open-source multimodal AI, excels in text and visual data processing, and can handle up to 30 high-resolution images per input or a 300-page book. It demonstrates top performance across diverse benchmarks, making it ideal for tasks like chart interpretation, document analysis, and image understanding. Le Chat, now powered by Pixtral Large, has been enhanced with features such as web search with citations, a canvas for ideation, advanced document and image analysis, image generation, and task agents for automation. Despite these advancements, Mistral's models and API usage by large enterprises remain behind those of U.S.-based companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Microsoft.

Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, is reportedly raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation to purchase 100,000 Nvidia chips for a new supercomputer in Memphis. The funding, expected to close next week, is a combination of $5 billion from Middle Eastern sovereign funds and $1 billion from other investors. The company, which Musk launched in 2023, aims to "understand the true nature of the universe" and has already released a chatbot called Grok, which competes with similar technologies from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Amidst these developments, Musk is also actively working with the new administration of President-elect Donald Trump on its approach to AI and technology.
