#### [ChatGPT maker OpenAI faces class action over how it used people’s data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/28/openai-chatgpt-lawsuit-class-action/)
![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RGMO7UT4IBV7AK5YEXLNP6POAY_size-normalized.jpg)

OpenAI, the company behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT, is facing a class-action lawsuit alleging that it violated the copyrights and privacy of millions of internet users by using their data without permission. The lawsuit argues that OpenAI scraped data from social media comments, blog posts, Wikipedia articles, and other sources to train its AI technology. The case raises questions about the legality of using publicly available data to train AI models and could set a precedent for how AI algorithms are trained and how people are compensated for the use of their data. The lawsuit adds to the growing list of legal challenges faced by companies in the AI industry. The key takeaway from the article is that the lawsuit against OpenAI highlights the need for clearer regulations and transparency around the use of data in AI development.

Nasa engineers are developing an AI interface that could allow astronauts to communicate with their spacecraft and mission controllers to converse with AI-powered robots on distant planets and moons. The AI, similar to ChatGPT, could be included on the Lunar Gateway space station as part of the Artemis program. The system would have a natural language interface, allowing astronauts and mission control to communicate with it easily. The AI would also be able to detect and possibly fix glitches and inefficiencies in real-time. The goal is to have conversational interactions with space vehicles and receive alerts and interesting findings from them. The AI would also enable collaborative learning among robotic rovers on distant planets through federated learning, without the need to transmit large amounts of data back to Earth. The key takeaway is that Nasa is working on developing advanced AI interfaces to enhance communication and collaboration in space exploration.

#### [OpenAI Plans ChatGPT ‘Personal Assistant for Work,’ Setting Up Microsoft Rivalry](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-plans-chatgpt-personal-assistant-for-work-setting-up-microsoft-rivalry?rc=tuauap)
![](https://tii.imgix.net/production/articles/10749/e7510f71-3400-41bc-ae56-2b76c75f2d1e.jpg?fm=jpg&auto=compress&w=1200&frame=0)

OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has revealed plans to transform the chatbot into a "supersmart personal assistant for work." This assistant would have knowledge about an individual and their workplace, enabling it to perform tasks like drafting emails or documents in the person's style and with up-to-date business information. This move puts OpenAI in potential competition with Microsoft, its primary business partner, as well as other OpenAI software customers like Salesforce, who also aim to develop AI assistants for work. OpenAI's focus will now be on expanding ChatGPT's capabilities.

#### [How the Great AI Flood Could Kill the Internet](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/how-the-great-ai-flood-could-kill)
![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0e77c66-7377-4918-8848-8d2bfd85b99c_1200x960.png)

The rise of AI-generated books on Amazon's bestselling lists highlights the potential threat to the online information ecosystem. While the quality of these books is poor, click farms are using bots to manipulate rankings and monetize the system. This is just the latest development in the relationship between humans and writing, from the exclusive access of the high class to the democratization of information through the printing press and the internet. However, the algorithmic feed and the emergence of AI tools have led to a passive consumption of content, allowing for the proliferation of low-quality AI-generated content. This "Great AI Flood" could lead to the internet becoming a desert populated by AI bots, potentially causing the loss of high-quality content and the degradation of the online experience. The key takeaway is that our laziness and reliance on AI tools may have unintended consequences for the internet.
