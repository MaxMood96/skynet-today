#### [Alibaba releases an â€˜openâ€™ challenger to OpenAIâ€™s o1 reasoning model](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/27/alibaba-releases-an-open-challenger-to-openais-o1-reasoning-model/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GettyImages-1285877166.jpg?resize=1200,675)

Alibaba's Qwen team has developed a new AI model, QwQ-32B-Preview, which rivals OpenAI's o1 model in reasoning capabilities. The model, which contains 32.5 billion parameters and can consider prompts up to 32,000 words in length, outperforms OpenAI's o1-preview and o1-mini models on certain benchmarks, including the AIME and MATH tests. However, it has some limitations, such as switching languages unexpectedly and underperforming on tasks requiring common sense reasoning. The model is available for download under an Apache 2.0 license, but only certain components have been released, making it impossible to fully replicate or understand its inner workings. This development comes as the effectiveness of "scaling laws" in AI is being questioned, leading to a search for new AI approaches and techniques, such as test-time compute, which is used in models like o1 and QwQ-32B-Preview.

DeepSeek has launched a new AI model, DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview, designed to address the reasoning gaps in current AI models by providing complete reasoning outputs. The model matches OpenAI's o1 preview-level performance and is available for testing through DeepSeek's chat interface. It incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, allowing the AI to present its thought process in real time, which is crucial for users who require detailed insight into how an AI model arrives at its conclusions. The model has demonstrated its capabilities through benchmarks like AIME and MATH, and is set to be open-sourced, making it accessible to the broader community for experimentation and integration.

#### [Ai2 releases new language models competitive with Metaâ€™s Llama](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/26/ai2-releases-new-language-models-competitive-with-metas-llama/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1652364481.jpg?resize=1200,675)

The nonprofit AI research organization Ai2 has released a new family of AI models, OLMo 2, which meets the Open Source Initiative's definition of open source AI. This means that the tools and data used to develop it are publicly available. The OLMo 2 family includes two models, one with 7 billion parameters (OLMo 7B) and one with 13 billion parameters (OLMo 13B), which can perform a range of text-based tasks. Ai2 used a dataset of 5 trillion tokens to train the models, resulting in models that are competitive with other open models like Meta's Llama 3.1. The OLMo 2 models can be downloaded from Ai2's website and used commercially under the Apache 2.0 license.
