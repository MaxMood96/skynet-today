#### [At UK's AI Summit developers and govts agree on testing to help manage risks](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-pm-sunak-lead-ai-summit-talks-before-musk-meeting-2023-11-02/)
![](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/kWTKbdH9pnFTBPwiideS6GaD3pM=/1200x628/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VD4LVZQ4WNPLXALIA7C3FPVQBU.jpg)

Leading AI developers and governments have agreed to collaborate on testing new AI models before their release to manage the risks associated with the technology. The agreement was reached at the UK's artificial intelligence summit, where political leaders from the US, EU, and China signed a declaration to share a common approach to identifying and mitigating risks. The summit also saw the establishment of an international panel on risk and the delivery of a "State of the Science" report by AI expert Yoshua Bengio. The aim is to rigorously assess AI models before and after deployment, rather than relying solely on the companies developing them. The summit brought together politicians, academics, and tech executives to discuss the future of AI and explore the possibility of establishing an independent body for global oversight.

#### [Tesla Wins Suit That Blamed Its Software for Deadly Crash](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/31/business/tesla-autopilot-jury-decision.html)

A California jury has ruled that Tesla's driver-assistance software, Autopilot, was not at fault for a deadly crash that killed a Tesla owner and injured two passengers. This is the first verdict involving a fatal crash where Tesla's Autopilot system was blamed. The decision could have implications for other pending cases and impact consumer perceptions of Tesla's vehicles. Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, has been promoting the potential profitability of self-driving software, with Tesla charging up to $199 per month for its most advanced driver-assistance system, Full Self-Driving.

#### [Regulating AI by Executive Order is the Real AI Risk](https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/211-regulating-ai-by-executive-order)
![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8698480b-47bb-4cab-83ea-5999b3cb478c_1247x769.jpeg)

The article criticizes President Biden's Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence (AI), arguing that it is a premature and pessimistic political solution to unknown technical problems. The author highlights that the order is focused on what can be regulated rather than what should be regulated, and it lacks a clear owner or leading science consensus. The article raises concerns about the potential stifling of innovation and the circumvention of the democratic process. It also questions the need for immediate regulation of AI and argues that the government should foster optimism and innovation instead. The author suggests that the order may benefit incumbent technology companies and hinder new entrants into the AI market.
