#### [ChatGPT‚Äôs 1-year anniversary: how it changed the world](https://venturebeat.com/ai/chatgpts-1-year-anniversary-how-it-changed-the-world/)
![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DALL¬∑E-2023-11-29-09.37.00-A-fantastical-and-imaginative-scene-featuring-a-1st-birthday-cake-sitting-atop-a-world-globe.-The-globe-is-highly-detailed-showing-continents-and-oce.png?w=1200&strip=all)

ChatGPT, the AI-powered language model developed by OpenAI, is celebrating its one-year anniversary. Since its launch, ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing consumer application in history, allowing users to engage in interactive and conversational dialogue with the model. The tool has received both praise and criticism, with some hailing it as a disruptive technology and others calling it unreliable. OpenAI has released updates to the model, including the GPT-4, which offers improved problem-solving abilities and the ability to handle longer-form content. ChatGPT has also faced competition from other companies, such as Anthropic and Google DeepMind. OpenAI has expanded the capabilities of ChatGPT by introducing plugins and giving it access to the internet for up-to-date information. Despite some controversies and leadership changes at OpenAI, ChatGPT has made a significant impact in the past year and is poised to continue evolving in the future.

#### [Sam Altman returns as CEO, OpenAI has a new initial board](https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board)

#### [Amazon Introduces Q, an A.I. Chatbot for Companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/technology/amazon-ai-chatbot-q.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/11/28/business/28AMAZON-Q-VIDEOCOVER/28AMAZON-Q-VIDEOCOVER-facebookJumbo.png)

Amazon has introduced Q, an AI chatbot designed specifically for companies. Many businesses were interested in using chatbots in the workplace, but had concerns about security and privacy. In response, Amazon built Q to be more secure and private than consumer chatbots. Q can have the same security permissions that business customers have already set up for their users, ensuring that sensitive data is not accessed by unauthorized individuals. For example, if an employee in marketing does not have access to financial forecasts, Q will not provide them with that information when asked.

#### [Making an image with generative AI uses as much energy as charging your phone](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/12/01/1084189/making-an-image-with-generative-ai-uses-as-much-energy-as-charging-your-phone/)
![](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AI-energyimpact1b.jpg?resize=1200,600)

A recent study has found that generating an image using AI consumes as much energy as charging a phone. The energy consumption of AI tools has been overlooked in understanding their carbon footprint. The study also highlights that newer, larger generative models are more carbon-intensive than older AI models. The emissions associated with using AI on a day-to-day basis far exceed the emissions from training large models. For popular models, the emissions from usage can surpass the emissions from training in just a few weeks. This study sheds light on the carbon footprint of AI and emphasizes the need for companies to be accountable for their energy usage and emissions.
