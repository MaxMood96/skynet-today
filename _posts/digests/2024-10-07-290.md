OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence startup, has successfully closed the largest venture capital round in history, raising $6.6 billion and bringing its total funding to $17.9 billion. The funding round, led by previous investor Thrive Capital, values OpenAI at a staggering $157 billion post-money and also includes a significant credit line. In other AI news, ElevenLabs, a company specializing in AI tools for synthetic voice generation and real-time video dubbing, is reportedly in talks for a new funding round that could value it at $3 billion. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's X has seen a significant decrease in its valuation, now estimated to be worth less than a quarter of its $44 billion purchase price, according to Fidelity's Blue Chip Growth Fund.

#### [OpenAI‚Äôs DevDay brings Realtime API and other treats for AI app developers](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/openais-devday-brings-realtime-api-and-other-treats-for-ai-app-developers/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1778705443.jpg?resize=1200,675)

OpenAI, amidst executive departures and fundraising developments, has announced several new tools at its 2024 DevDay, including a public beta of its "Realtime API" for building apps with low-latency, AI-generated voice responses. The Realtime API allows developers to create nearly real-time, speech-to-speech experiences in their apps, with six distinct voices provided by OpenAI. The company also introduced vision fine-tuning in its API, enabling developers to use images and text to fine-tune their applications of GPT-4o, and a model distillation feature to improve the performance of smaller AI models. Despite these advancements, OpenAI did not announce any new AI models during DevDay this year, and developers awaiting the release of OpenAI o1 or the video generation model, Sora, will have to wait longer.


#### [OpenAI launches new ‚ÄòCanvas‚Äô ChatGPT interface tailored to writing and coding projects](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/03/openai-launches-new-canvas-chatgpt-interface-tailored-to-writing-and-coding-projects/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-03-at-12.27.28PM.png?resize=1200,719)

OpenAI has launched a new interface for ChatGPT, named 'Canvas', designed to facilitate writing and coding projects. The interface opens a separate workspace window where users can generate writing or code, and then select sections for the AI model to edit. Canvas is currently in beta and is being rolled out to ChatGPT Plus and Teams users, with Enterprise and Edu users to follow. The new interface is part of OpenAI's strategy to compete with other AI providers and expand its paid user base. Canvas also includes features for coding, such as adding in-line documentation, explaining code, and suggesting specific edits for user-written or generated code.

#### [People are using Google study software to make AI podcasts‚Äîand they‚Äôre weird and amazing](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/10/03/1104978/people-are-using-google-study-software-to-make-ai-podcasts-and-theyre-weird-and-amazing/)
![](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ai-podcastsc.jpg?resize=1200,600)

Google's study software, NotebookLM, is being utilized by users to create AI-generated podcasts, with the tool generating a podcast called Deep Dive that features realistic male and female voices discussing uploaded content. The AI system is designed to create engaging audio in an "upbeat, hyper-interested tone," according to Raiza Martin, the product lead for NotebookLM. The company is now working on adding more customization options, such as changing the length, format, voices, and languages. Despite its success, the tool is not immune from issues that affect generative AI, such as hallucinations and bias. Notably, Andrej Karpathy, a member of OpenAI‚Äôs founding team and former director of AI at Tesla, used NotebookLM to create his own AI podcast series, Histories of Mysteries, in just two hours.


#### [Black Forest Labs releases Flux 1.1 Pro and an API](https://venturebeat.com/ai/black-forest-labs-releases-flux-1-1-pro-and-an-api/)
![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/pikaso_edit_Candid-image-photography-natural-textures-highly-r.jpeg?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all)

Black Forest Labs (BFL), the startup behind the Stable Diffusion AI image generation model, has released a new, faster text-to-image model called Flux 1.1 Pro, along with a paid application programming interface (API). The new model, which is six times faster than its predecessor, Flux 1.0 Pro, improves image quality, prompt adherence, and diversity, and is available through partners like together.ai, Replicate, fal.ai, and Freepik. The BFL API allows developers to integrate the company's generative capabilities into their own applications, with pricing starting at 4 cents per image. This release comes amid a contentious legal landscape, with generative AI companies like Stability AI and Midjourney facing lawsuits over their training datasets, and positions BFL as a major player in the AI-driven media space.
