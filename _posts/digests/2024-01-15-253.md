#### [The Rabbit R1 is an AI-powered gadget that can use your apps for you](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/9/24030667/rabbit-r1-ai-action-model-price-release-date)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAF7NfTHGaJxpqyJDKfkwb-Poz8=/0x0:2880x2233/1200x628/filters:focal(1440x1117:1441x1118)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25212782/rabbit_r1_front.jpg)

Rabbit, an AI startup, has launched a standalone AI device called the R1, which is designed to use your apps for you. The device, priced at $199, features a 2.88-inch touchscreen, a rotating camera, a scroll wheel/button for navigation, a 2.3GHz MediaTek processor, 4GB of memory, and 128GB of storage. The R1 runs on Rabbit's operating system, Rabbit OS, which is based on a "Large Action Model" that acts as a universal controller for apps. The device can control music, order a car, buy groceries, send messages, and more through a single interface. The R1 also has a dedicated training mode, allowing users to teach the device how to perform specific tasks. The device is available for pre-order and is expected to start shipping in March.


#### [Towards Conversational Diagnostic AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05654v1)


The article discusses the development of a conversational medical AI system, AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), optimized for clinical history-taking and diagnostic dialogue. The system leverages recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to understand clinical language, acquire information under uncertainty, and engage in natural, diagnostically useful medical conversations. The authors developed a self-play based simulated diagnostic dialogue environment to scale AMIE across various specialties and scenarios, and an inference time chain-of-reasoning strategy to improve its diagnostic accuracy and conversation quality. A pilot evaluation rubric was also developed to assess the history-taking, diagnostic reasoning, communication skills, and empathy of the AI. The system was tested in a blinded remote OSCE study with 149 case scenarios from clinical providers in Canada, the UK, and India, where it exhibited superior diagnostic accuracy compared to primary care physicians (PCPs). However, the authors note that the study has limitations, including the use of a text-chat interface, which was unfamiliar to PCPs for remote consultation.

OpenAI has officially launched its GPT Store, a platform where users can share their custom chatbots, after several months of delay. The store, which expands the potential use cases of ChatGPT and broadens OpenAI's ecosystem, has seen over 3 million bots created by users since the announcement of the GPT Builder program. The platform is currently available to those who subscribe to OpenAI's paid tiers, and the company plans to initiate a revenue sharing program with GPT creators based on user engagement. In preparation for the store's launch, OpenAI established a review system to ensure custom GPTs adhere to its brand guidelines and usage policies, and updated its reporting process for harmful or unsafe GPTs.


#### [SAG-AFTRA Signs Deal With Voiceover Studio for AI Use in Video Games](https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/sag-aftra-ai-voiceover-studio-video-games-1235866313/)

SAG-AFTRA, the union representing actors and performers, has signed a deal with AI voiceover studio, Replica Studios, outlining terms for the use of artificial intelligence in video games. The agreement includes provisions for informed consent for the creation of digital voice replicas using AI, and requirements for the secure storage of these digital assets. The deal follows a 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike that resulted in consent and compensation requirements for AI replication of actors' likenesses. The agreement with Replica Studios is seen as a potential catalyst for ongoing negotiations with major video game studios, and is expected to create new employment opportunities for voiceover performers interested in licensing their voices for video game use.
