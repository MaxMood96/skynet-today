#### [First AI Pathology Program Approved: Helps Detect Prostate Cancer](https://www.mlo-online.com/diagnostics/pathology/article/21239541/fda-authorizes-software-that-can-help-identify-prostate-cancer)

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first AI-based software product to help diagnose diseases.
The software, developed by Paige.AI, will assist doctors in diagnosing prostate cancers by processing images from prostate biopsies.
In its clinical trial, 16 pathologists examined 527 images of biopsies, (171 cancerous and 356 benign), and each pathologist completed assessments both with and without the assistance of Paige.AI's software.
The study found that when doctors used the AI-based software to assist their assements, correct diagnosis of cancerous samples improved by 7.3%, while accuracy for benign samples were unaffected.
The Co-founder and Chief Medical Officer at Paige.AI hopes that this approval will "pave the way for the introduction of numerous future tools to help standardize pathology diagnosis."
