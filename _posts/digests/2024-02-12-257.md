#### [Hugging Face Launches Chat Assistants, Takes on OpenAIâ€™s GPT Store](https://analyticsindiamag.com/hugging-face-launches-chat-assistants-takes-on-openais-gpt-store/)
![](https://8f430952.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hugging-face-low-res-1300x731.gif)

Hugging Face, an open-source hub for AI models, has launched a new feature called the Hugging Chat Assistant, which allows users to create personalized chat assistants. This feature is similar to OpenAI's GPT models, but with the added advantage of being open-source, allowing users to use and share the feature without any subscription fee, unlike OpenAI's $20 subscription for ChatGPT Plus. However, Hugging Face's Chat Assistants currently lack some features found in OpenAI's custom GPTs, such as RAG, web search, actions, and a GPT builder. Despite this, the platform has seen rapid growth since its launch, with over 4,000 Assistants created, and plans to introduce seven additional open-source stores in the near future.


#### [Googleâ€™s AI now goes by a new name: Gemini](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065553/google-gemini-ios-android-app-duet-bard)

Google has rebranded its AI work under the name Gemini, which will replace Google Assistant as the default assistant on Android devices. Gemini, a combination of an assistant, chatbot, and search engine, will also be accessible on iOS through the Google app. The AI features in Google's Workspace apps, previously known as "Duet AI", will also be known as Gemini. Users can subscribe to Gemini Advanced, part of the new $20-a-month Google One AI Premium plan, to access Gemini Ultra, the most powerful version of the model. Google's move to consolidate its AI efforts under Gemini is seen as a strategic step to compete with other powerful AI competitors like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity.
