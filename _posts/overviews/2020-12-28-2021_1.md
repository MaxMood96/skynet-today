## Overview

TODO: Update

With 2021 quickly approaching its second half, we'd like to reflect on what's happened in AI during a year that began in the midst of the pandemic. Above is a wordcloud of the most common words used in titles of articles we've curated in our ['Last Week in AI' newsletter](https://lastweekin.ai/) over this past year. This reflects just about 1000 articles that we've included in the newsletter in 2021 so far:

 <figcaption> Counts of terms in articles vs time</figcaption>
</figure>

Unsurprisingly, the vague but recognizable term "AI" remained the most popular term to use in article titles, with specifics such as "Deep Learning" or "neural network" remaining comparatively rare:

Digging a bit deeper, we find that Coronavirus and Facial Recognition were the biggest topics of the year, followed by bias, deepfakes, and other topics:

But enough overview -- let's go through the most significant articles we've curated from the past year, month by month. 
As in with our newsletter, these articles will be about Advances & Business, Concerns & Hype, Analysis & Policy, and in some cases Expert Opinions & Discussion within the field. 
They will be presented in chronological order, and represent a curated selection that we believe are particularly noteworthy.

## [January](https://lastweekin.ai/p/97)

A big topic carried over from last year is the explosion of facial recognition software and the growing public pushback they are receiving, and January started off with new lawsuits and regulations on their uses.
Separately, OpenAI publicized a new impressive work called CLIP that is able to generate pictures from language prompts.

## [February](https://lastweekin.ai/p/101)

Another thread carried over from last year is the turmoil at Google's Ethical AI team. 
Following the firing of researcher Timnit Gebru, Google fired Margaret Mitchell, leading to more controversy in the press.
Again on the topic of facial recognition, a crowdsourced map was produced by Amnesty International to expose where these cameras might be watching. An OECD task force led by former OpenAI policy director Jack Clark was formed to calculate compute needs for national governments in an effort to craft better-informed AI policy.

## [March](https://lastweekin.ai/p/106)

The AI Index report released in March paints an optimistic outlook on the future of AI development - we are seeing significant increases in private AI R&D, especially in the healthcare. Simultaneously, concerns about AI continue to manifest. Karen Hao of the _MIT Technology Review_ interviewed an important player in Facebook's AI Ethics group, and found that Facebook was over-focusing on AI bias at the expense of grappling with the more destructive features of its AI systems. In another development stemming from Google's Ethical AI fallout, a researcher publicly rejected a grant from the behemoth.

## [April](https://lastweekin.ai/p/110)

Another report release in April, the Analysis on U.S. AI Workforce, shows how AI workers grew 4x as fast as all U.S. occupations.
In this month we also saw more reports of EU's growing regulations on AI commercial applications in high-risk areas.

## [May](https://lastweekin.ai/p/114)

Late May saw Google announcing their new large language models that can significantly impact how search and other Google products work in the future.
Perhaps this drive to commercialize large lanugage models is behind the firing of its Ethical AI team leads months before, who at the time were focused on characterizing the potential harm of using such models.
