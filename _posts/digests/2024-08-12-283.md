The Technology Innovation Institute (TII) has introduced Falcon Mamba 7B, a new large language model that uses a State Space Language Model (SSLM) architecture, marking a shift from traditional transformer-based designs. SSLMs, a newer approach to natural language processing, can process longer text sequences more efficiently, require less memory, and maintain consistent performance regardless of input size. Falcon Mamba 7B has been independently verified by Hugging Face as the top-performing open-source SSLM globally, outperforming established transformer-based models in benchmark tests. Available on the Hugging Face platform, Falcon Mamba 7B represents a significant step in language model development, potentially offering more efficient and capable AI systems for a wide range of text-based tasks.

![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Figure-02-Trailer.2024-08-05-13_32_45.gif?w=800)

Figure has introduced its latest humanoid robot, Figure 02, which is designed to work alongside humans in a factory setting. The robot, developed in partnership with OpenAI, is equipped with speakers and microphones for natural language conversations, making it easier for humans to instruct the robot and understand its actions. The robot also features six RGB cameras, an onboard visual language model, improved CPU/GPU computing, and improved hands with 16 degrees of freedom. Figure has begun pilot programs with BMW, and while there is no timeline for a wider rollout, the company hints at future applications beyond the factory floor, including in the home.

#### [AI-driven technique can generate quality 3D assets from 2D images 'in seconds' ‚Äî VFusion3D aims to transform VR, gaming, and digital design](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/ai-driven-technique-can-generate-quality-3d-assets-from-2d-images-in-seconds)
![](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CytVJs4eJLF6RCs2Jg56g8-1200-80.jpg)

A research paper by scientists from Meta and Oxford University introduces VFusion3D, an AI-driven technique capable of generating high-quality 3D models from 2D images in seconds. The technology, which could revolutionize the gaming, VR, and design industries, is trained on text, images, and videos, rather than existing 3D models. The VFusion3D pipeline uses a small amount of 3D data to fine-tune a video diffusion model, with videos providing various angles of an object for accurate 3D reproductions. The team used a video model called EMU Video, trained with a variety of videos, to create VFusion3D, which can generate 3D assets from a single image, regardless of the viewing angle. The researchers have also compared VFusion3D's performance and quality against other 3D generative models.

#### [Artists‚Äô lawsuit against generative AI makers can go forward, judge says](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/artists-lawsuit-against-generative-ai-makers-can-go-forward-judge-says/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ai-in-brief.jpg?resize=1200,675)

A class action lawsuit against AI companies Stability, Runway, and DeviantArt, filed by artists alleging copyright infringement, has been partially approved to proceed by a judge. The lawsuit accuses these companies of illegally training their AI systems on copyrighted works. While some of the plaintiffs' claims were dismissed, others were allowed to continue, potentially leading to a trial. This development is unfavorable for the AI companies, as even a victory would entail a costly and lengthy legal process, and it highlights a broader issue of copyright claims faced by many companies in the AI industry.
