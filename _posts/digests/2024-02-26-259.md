Chinese artificial intelligence start-up, Moonshot AI, has successfully raised over US$1 billion in a funding round led by Alibaba Group Holding and venture capital firm HongShan. This marks the largest single financing raised by a Chinese AI start-up since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Moonshot AI, founded by Yang Zhilin, a Tsinghua University graduate, launched its smart chatbot Kimi Chat in October, which is built on its self-developed Moonshot large language model (LLM) capable of processing up to 200,000 Chinese characters in a context window. The funding round underscores the continued strong interest in generative AI start-ups in mainland China, which led global investments into such firms in the first half of 2023.


#### [Google apologizes for ‚Äòmissing the mark‚Äô after Gemini generated racially diverse Nazis](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079371/google-ai-gemini-generative-inaccurate-historical)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cS1-rBctlD2sKSLPMcmGswiCuys=/0x0:1618x1162/1200x628/filters:focal(621x533:622x534)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25297898/Screen_Shot_2024_02_21_at_2.56.19_PM.png)

Google has issued an apology for inaccuracies in historical image generation by its Gemini AI tool, following criticism that it inaccurately depicted white historical figures and groups as people of color. The controversy, largely fueled by right-wing figures, arose from the tool's tendency to generate images of people of color when prompted to generate images of specific white figures or groups, such as the US Founding Fathers or Nazi-era German soldiers. Google's statement acknowledged the inaccuracies and promised improvements, but did not specify which images were considered erroneous. The issue highlights the ongoing challenge of racial bias in AI, with image generators often amplifying stereotypes due to their training on large corpuses of pictures and written captions.
