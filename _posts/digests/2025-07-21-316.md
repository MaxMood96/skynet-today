#### [Anthropic, Google, OpenAI and xAI granted up to $200 million for AI work from Defense Department](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/14/anthropic-google-openai-xai-granted-up-to-200-million-from-dod.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108075961-1734119319915-gettyimages-2189090576-AFP_36QA33P.jpeg?v=1752511789&w=1920&h=1080)

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has announced contract awards of up to $200 million for artificial intelligence (AI) development to four companies: Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI. The Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office of the DoD stated that these awards aim to accelerate the adoption of advanced AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges. The companies will work on developing AI agents across several mission areas within the agency. Doug Matty, the DoD's chief digital and AI officer, emphasized that the adoption of AI is transforming the Department's ability to support warfighters and maintain a strategic advantage over adversaries.

Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, also announced a new suite of products called Grok for Government, which makes the company's models available to U.S. government customers. These products can be purchased through the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule by federal government departments, agencies, or offices. This announcement comes after xAI launched a new version of Grok and Grok for Government services following a backlash over the chatbot generating and spreading offensive content. OpenAI, which was previously awarded a year-long $200 million contract from the DoD in 2024, has also launched OpenAI for Government for U.S. federal, state, and local government workers.

#### [OpenAIâ€™s new ChatGPT Agent can control an entire computer and do tasks for you](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/709158/openai-new-release-chatgpt-agent-operator-deep-research)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/STK_414_AI_CHATBOT_R2_CVirginia_B.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

OpenAI has introduced a new AI tool, ChatGPT Agent, which can perform complex, multi-step tasks on a user's behalf using its own "virtual computer". The tool, powered by a new model developed specifically for the product, can perform tasks such as briefing a user on upcoming meetings, planning and purchasing ingredients for a meal, and creating a slide deck based on its analysis of competing companies. The model behind ChatGPT Agent was trained on complex tasks that require multiple tools, like a text browser, visual browser, and terminal where users can import their own data, via reinforcement learning. The tool combines the capabilities of Operator and Deep Research, two of OpenAI's existing AI tools.

The development of ChatGPT Agent involved the unification of the teams behind Operator and Deep Research. The tool can perform tasks like planning a date night by connecting to Google Calendar and OpenTable, and generating a research report on specific topics. Despite being a bit slow, the tool is designed to perform tasks in the background, allowing users to return to it later. Before performing any irreversible actions, such as sending an email or making a booking, the tool asks for user permission. OpenAI has also activated safeguards for "high biological and chemical capabilities" due to the increased capabilities of the model behind the tool. The tool is being rolled out to Pro, Plus, and Team users, with availability for ChatGPT Enterprise and Education users expected later this summer.


#### [Cognition, maker of the AI coding agent Devin, acquires Windsurf](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/cognition-maker-of-the-ai-coding-agent-devin-acquires-windsurf/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-2.44.29PM.png?resize=1200,616)

Cognition, the startup behind the AI coding agent Devin, has announced its acquisition of AI coding startup Windsurf. This comes after Google's $2.4 billion reverse-acquihire of Windsurf's CEO and other key personnel, leaving the majority of the 250-person team behind. The acquisition includes Windsurf's IP and product, its AI-powered integrated development environment (IDE), and all remaining employees. While the purchase price was not disclosed, Windsurf had achieved an annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of $82 million, with enterprise ARR doubling quarter-over-quarter, and a user base of at least 350 enterprise customers and hundreds of thousands of daily active users.

The acquisition of Windsurf by Cognition represents a significant development in the race to create AI coding tools. Windsurf's team will continue to work on its AI-powered IDE, while Cognition will continue to develop its AI coding agent, Devin. Eventually, Cognition plans to integrate Windsurf's IP and capabilities into its own products. This acquisition could potentially supercharge Cognition's ability to compete with giants in the AI coding space, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cursor. With the addition of Windsurf's talent and IP, Cognition now has the versatility of offering both AI coding agents and an AI-powered IDE, potentially enhancing its value proposition in the market.

#### [Google A.I. System Wins Gold In International Math Olympiad](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/technology/google-ai-international-mathematics-olympiad.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/21/business/21BIZ-AI-MATH/21BIZ-AI-MATH-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Google DeepMind's artificial intelligence system has achieved a "gold medal" status in the annual International Mathematical Olympiad, a prestigious math competition for high school students. This is the first time an AI has reached this level of success, solving five out of the six problems at the 2025 competition held in Australia. This achievement is indicative of the ongoing improvements in AI systems by leading companies in areas such as math, science, and computer coding. Such technology could potentially expedite research in mathematics and science and streamline the work of experienced computer programmers.

In related news, just two days before Google's announcement, an OpenAI researcher claimed that their startup had developed technology that achieved a similar score on this year's Olympiad questions, although it did not officially participate in the competition. This suggests a growing trend of AI systems being capable of high-level problem-solving in mathematical and scientific domains, which could have significant implications for future research and development in these fields.
