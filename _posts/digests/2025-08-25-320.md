#### [Anthropic Settles High-Profile AI Copyright Lawsuit Brought by Book Authors](https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-settles-copyright-lawsuit-authors/)
![](https://media.wired.com/photos/68adfa76d6e72970f29826e0/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2229149370.jpg)

Anthropic reached a preliminary settlement in a class action brought by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, averting a December trial and potentially catastrophic statutory damages. Judge William Alsup had largely sided with Anthropic on ‚Äúfair use‚Äù for model training at summary judgment, but found the company likely ‚Äúpirated‚Äù works by acquiring them from shadow libraries like LibGen, allowing the class claim to proceed. With statutory damages starting at $750 per infringed work and an alleged corpus of about 7 million books, Anthropic faced theoretical exposure in the billions to over $1 trillion. The settlement is expected to be finalized September 3; plaintiffs‚Äô counsel called it ‚Äúhistoric,‚Äù while Anthropic declined comment.

The class notification process had only just begun, with the Authors Guild alerting writers and a ‚Äúlist of affected works‚Äù due September 1‚Äîmeaning many potential class members were not part of negotiations. Legal scholars noted Anthropic had ‚Äúfew defenses at trial‚Äù on the acquisition issue after Alsup‚Äôs ruling, prompting a rapid strategic shift even as the company brought in a new trial team. While the outcome sets no legal precedent, the terms will be closely scrutinized amid parallel suits, including a major case by record labels over training on copyrighted lyrics and BitTorrent-based song downloads. Key timeline: summary judgment in June, settlement filed August 26, finalization targeted for September 3.

#### [Anthropic launches a Claude AI agent that lives in Chrome](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/anthropic-launches-a-claude-ai-agent-that-lives-in-chrome/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Claude-Chrome-Ext_email-hero-hero.png?w=1200)

Anthropic debuted a research preview of ‚ÄúClaude for Chrome,‚Äù a sidecar AI agent that runs as a Chrome extension with full page context. It‚Äôs rolling out to 1,000 Anthropic Max subscribers ($100‚Äì$200/month), with a waitlist open. Users can optionally grant the agent permission to navigate, fill forms, and complete tasks, and the extension maintains state across tabs. The move joins a broader push into AI-powered browsing, alongside Perplexity‚Äôs Comet, reported OpenAI browser efforts, and Google‚Äôs Gemini integrations.

Safety is a headline focus: Anthropic highlights new risks from browser-accessible agents, especially indirect prompt injection via hidden webpage instructions‚Äîrecently flagged and patched in Comet. The company reports defenses that cut prompt injection success from 23.6% to 11.2%, default blocks for categories like financial services, adult content, and piracy, and user controls to restrict site access. High‚Äërisk actions (publishing, purchasing, sharing personal data) require explicit permission. The launch follows Anthropic‚Äôs October 2024 desktop-control agent, which faced speed and reliability issues; while modern agents like Comet and ChatGPT Agent handle simple tasks well, they still struggle with complex workflows.

#### [Google Gemini‚Äôs AI image model gets a ‚Äòbananas‚Äô upgrade](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/google-geminis-ai-image-model-gets-a-bananas-upgrade/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Gemini_Generated_Image_gdibn3gdibn3gdib.png?resize=1200,627)

Google is rolling out Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, a native image generation and editing capability inside its Gemini 2.5 Flash model, to all Gemini app users and to developers via the Gemini API, Google AI Studio, and Vertex AI. The tool emphasizes fine-grained, instruction-following edits that preserve identity and scene consistency‚Äîsuch as changing a shirt color without distorting faces or backgrounds‚Äîand can blend multiple references (e.g., a dog and a person) while keeping likenesses. Google says the model is state-of-the-art on LMArena and other benchmarks; it previously appeared there under the pseudonym ‚Äúnano-banana,‚Äù sparking social media buzz. Multi-turn editing, stronger ‚Äúworld knowledge,‚Äù and multi-reference composition (like merging a sofa photo, a living room image, and a color palette) are supported.

Positioned against OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o image tools and Meta‚Äôs licensed Midjourney offerings‚Äîamid strong benchmark leaders like Black Forest Labs‚Äô FLUX‚Äîthe update aims to improve visual quality, instruction adherence, and edit seamlessness for consumer tasks such as home and garden visualization, per product lead Nicole Brichtova. Safeguards include TOS restrictions on non-consensual intimate imagery and visible watermarks plus metadata identifiers, following prior issues with historically inaccurate people images. Google hopes the upgrade helps narrow the usage gap with ChatGPT‚Äôs 700M weekly users; Gemini reported 450M monthly users in July.
