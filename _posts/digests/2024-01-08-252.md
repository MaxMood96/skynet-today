#### [DeepMind is trying to train robots for real-world activities](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/google-deepmind-robot-constitution-real-world-safety)
![](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/robot.png)

Google's DeepMind is developing multiple research projects aimed at creating robots capable of making faster decisions and functioning in real-world scenarios. The first project, AutoRT, combines large foundational models with a robot control model, enabling robots to gather training data in new environments and multitask. The system has been tested in real-world settings, directing up to 20 robots simultaneously in various tasks. To ensure safety, DeepMind has integrated a "robot constitution" into AutoRT, which includes safety measures from classical robotics and Isaac Asimovâ€™s Three Laws of Robotics. Another system, SARA-RT, improves the efficiency of robotic transformer models, while the third project, RT-Trajectory, helps robots become more generalized in their tasks by providing visual hints during training. DeepMind's efforts are part of a broader trend towards integrating AI and robotics in practical, everyday applications.


#### [The Times Sues OpenAI and Microsoft Over A.I. Use of Copyrighted Work](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/12/26/multimedia/00Times-lmkv/00Times-lmkv-facebookJumbo.jpg)

The New York Times has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, accusing them of copyright infringement for using its published work to train artificial intelligence technologies without authorization. The lawsuit, the first of its kind from a major American media organization, alleges that millions of Times articles were used to train chatbots, which now compete with the Times as a source of information. The Times is seeking "billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages" and demands the destruction of any chatbot models and training data that use its copyrighted material. The Times had previously approached both companies in April to discuss its concerns and seek a resolution, but no agreement was reached.


#### [Baidu says its ChatGPT rival Ernie bot now has more than 100 million users](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/29/baidu-says-its-chatgpt-rival-ernie-bot-has-more-than-100-million-users.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107352505-1703812314338-gettyimages-1809495210-vcg111465933338.jpeg?v=1703812470&w=1920&h=1080)

Chinese tech giant Baidu has announced that its artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, Ernie bot, has reached over 100 million users. This AI product, similar to Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT, is primarily used in Chinese but also supports English. To register, users need a China mobile number. The chatbot, known as "Wenxinyiyan" in Mandarin, was launched in March but only received regulatory approval for widespread use in late August. The company did not clarify whether the reported user numbers were active or for a specific time period.

#### [A list going viral reveals famous artists whose work was used to train AI generator](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/famous-artists-trained-ai-generator-viral-list-rcna131995)
![](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-01/240102-tim-burton-hayao-miyazaki-seth-macfarlane-seamless-3-up-split-3x2-ac-948p-340071.jpg)

A list revealing thousands of artists whose work was used to train an artificial intelligence (AI) art generator has gone viral, sparking a lawsuit against companies Midjourney, Stability AI, DeviantArt, and Runway AI. The companies are accused of misusing copyrighted work from visual artists to train their generative AI systems, with many artists alleging that their work was stolen without permission. The list, which includes nearly 4,700 artists and an additional 16,000 proposed additions, has highlighted frustrations with the lack of regulation around AI-generated art. The lawsuit argues that the AI models are built around human intelligence and creative expression, and that the profits from the misappropriation of these works flow directly into the defendants' pockets without consent, credit, or compensation to the artists.
