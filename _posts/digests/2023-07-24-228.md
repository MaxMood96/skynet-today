Google's Med-PaLM 2, an AI chatbot designed to answer medical questions, has been undergoing testing at the Mayo Clinic research hospital since April. Med-PaLM 2 is an updated version of PaLM 2, which was announced at Google I/O in May. The chatbot was trained on a curated set of medical expert demonstrations, making it more effective in healthcare conversations compared to other generalized chatbots. While Med-PaLM 2 still has some accuracy issues, it performed as well as actual doctors in terms of reasoning, consensus-supported answers, and comprehension. The chatbot is still in its early stages, but Google believes it has the potential to greatly benefit healthcare.

#### [Elon Musk unveils his AI company, X.AI](https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-x-ai-announcement)

Elon Musk has officially unveiled his new AI company, X.AI. The company's website and Twitter account have gone live, with Musk confirming his involvement by changing his Twitter bio to the @xAI handle. The website provides limited information, stating that the goal of xAI is to understand the true nature of the universe. The team consists of 12 members, including individuals who previously worked at OpenAI, Deep Mind, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. Musk's entry into the AI space has been anticipated, with reports in April stating that he was buying powerful Nvidia GPU processors for data training work.

#### [65% Of Top AI Companies Have Immigrant Founders](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2023/07/09/65-of-top-ai-companies-have-immigrant-founders/?sh=2149951339dd)

The latest study by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) suggests that immigrants play a crucial role in the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in the U.S., founding or co-founding nearly 65% of the country's top AI companies. Analyzing the Forbes AI 50, a list of top startups creating compelling AI business applications, the research reveals the diversity of immigrant entrepreneurs hailing from 21 countries. High-skilled immigrants contribute significantly to innovation, entrepreneurship, and job creation in the U.S., further underscoring the 2021 National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence's recommendation for immigration reforms. Examples of such AI-driven companies founded by immigrants include OpenAI, Pachama, Databricks, Eightfold.ai, and others providing a variety of products and services, from carbon estimation to medical diagnostics. The significant contribution of immigrant entrepreneurs to AI development in the U.S. highlights the need for supportive immigration policies to maintain the nation's AI leadership.

#### [Claude 2](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2)
![](https://www-images.anthropic.com/production/images/Claude2_Blog_V1-1.png)

Anthropic announced its latest large language model, Claude 2, that presents enhanced performance, extended response length, and access via API as well as a beta website, claude.ai. Marked improvements include increased scores on Bar exam multiple choice, GRE reading and writing exams, Python coding test, and grade-school math problems, suggesting heightened proficiency in coding, math, and reasoning. Notably, its input and output lengths have been extended (100k tokens! Compared to 32k for GPT-4), allowing it to handle documents of considerable size, up to hundreds of pages. Safety has also been prioritized, with the model producing less harmful outputs than its predecessor, Claude 1.3. The Claude 2 API is offered at the same cost as Claude 1.3 and is available for use in the US and the UK, with plans for broader accessibility. It's currently being used by businesses such as Jasper and Sourcegraph.
