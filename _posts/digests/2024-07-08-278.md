Kyutai has open-sourced Moshi, a real-time native multimodal foundation AI model that can listen and speak simultaneously. Moshi, which surpasses some functionalities of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o, is designed to understand and express emotions, and can handle two audio streams at once. The model was fine-tuned using 100,000 synthetic conversations and achieves an end-to-end latency of 200 milliseconds. Kyutai has also developed a smaller variant of Moshi that can run on consumer-sized devices. The company has incorporated watermarking to detect AI-generated audio and has committed to transparency and collaborative development by releasing Moshi as an open-source project. Future iterations of Moshi will be refined based on user feedback, and its licensing aims to foster widespread adoption and innovation.

#### [OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT Mac app was storing conversations in plain text](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191636/openai-chatgpt-mac-app-conversations-plain-text)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2e0-IzeyJ7KzcdVPwSc9wHJt9zc=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25462005/STK155_OPEN_AI_CVirginia_B.jpg)

OpenAI's ChatGPT macOS app was found to be storing user conversations in plain text, making them easily accessible to potential malicious actors. The issue was demonstrated by Pedro Jos√© Pereira Vieito, who created an app that could access and display these conversations. After being alerted by The Verge, OpenAI released an update that encrypts the chats, rendering Pereira Vieito's app ineffective. The original issue was discovered when Pereira Vieito questioned why OpenAI had opted out of using Apple's app sandbox protections, which are mandatory for software distributed via the Mac App Store but not for apps like ChatGPT that are distributed through their own websites.
