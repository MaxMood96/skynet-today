![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/OpenAI-logo-symmetry.jpg?resize=1200,675)

OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Enterprise, a business-focused version of its AI chatbot app, offering enhanced privacy, data analysis capabilities, and customization options. The new offering is designed to compete with similar enterprise-oriented chatbot services like Microsoft's Bing Chat Enterprise. ChatGPT Enterprise is powered by OpenAI's flagship AI model, GPT-4, and offers an admin console for managing employee usage, integrations for single sign-on and domain verification, and a dashboard with usage statistics. It also includes unlimited access to Advanced Data Analysis, a feature that allows ChatGPT to analyze data and generate insights. OpenAI emphasizes that all conversations with ChatGPT Enterprise are encrypted and it won't train models on business data sent to the platform. The company plans to further develop ChatGPT Enterprise based on customer feedback and future plans include a business offering for smaller teams and more powerful versions of Advanced Data Analysis.


#### [Itâ€™s a Weird Time for Driverless Cars](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/driverless-taxis-waymo-cruise/675161/)
![](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/YFoA494r5BTI1ZNjqT32WtRvlpk=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2023/08/self_driving_cars/original.jpg)

In San Francisco, self-driving taxis operated by Cruise and Waymo are becoming a common sight, despite numerous hiccups and safety concerns. The companies have been given permission to expand their operations, charging for rides and operating 24/7. However, incidents such as a Cruise vehicle colliding with a fire truck have raised questions about the safety and reliability of these autonomous vehicles. Despite these concerns, proponents argue that self-driving cars could significantly reduce the number of road fatalities caused by human error. The technology is still being tested and refined, with San Francisco serving as a major proving ground due to its challenging driving conditions. Critics argue that the risks and inconveniences currently posed by these vehicles outweigh the potential future benefits. The future of self-driving cars could also include applications beyond private taxi services, such as self-driving shuttle operations to supplement public transportation systems.
