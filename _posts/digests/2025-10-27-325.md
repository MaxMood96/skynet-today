#### [OpenAI completed its for-profit restructuring ‚Äî and struck a new deal with Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/news/807875/openai-microsoft-for-profit-agi)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gettyimages-2215434051.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.749338735387%2C100%2C78.501322529225&w=1200)

OpenAI finalized its for-profit restructuring by converting its operating arm into a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC, while its nonprofit parent is now the OpenAI Foundation. The Foundation holds equity valued at about $130 billion, will initially deploy $25 billion toward healthcare, disease, and ‚ÄúAI resilience,‚Äù and will gain additional ownership after an unspecified valuation milestone. After negotiations with California and Delaware AGs and a legal fight with Elon Musk, OpenAI shifted from a plan removing nonprofit control to one where the nonprofit keeps oversight and can own up to $100 billion of equity. A major open question remains whether the nonprofit will ultimately control core technology and any potential AGI.

OpenAI also signed a new deal with Microsoft that reduces Microsoft‚Äôs stake to roughly 27% (as-converted diluted, valued around $135 billion) and clarifies the ‚ÄúAGI clause.‚Äù Any AGI declaration by OpenAI must now be verified by an independent expert panel. Microsoft‚Äôs IP rights for models and products extend through 2032 and now include post-AGI models with safety guardrails, but its rights to OpenAI‚Äôs research expire by 2030 or upon AGI verification, whichever comes first. Key carve-outs: Microsoft‚Äôs IP rights do not cover OpenAI‚Äôs consumer hardware (e.g., the Jony Ive project), the partnership‚Äôs exclusivity is further loosened (OpenAI can work with third parties and release some open-weight models), Microsoft loses right of first refusal on compute, and OpenAI commits to an incremental $250 billion of Azure spend. Microsoft can now independently pursue AGI, with compute thresholds applying if it builds on OpenAI IP before AGI is verified.

#### [Google and Anthropic announce cloud deal worth tens of billions of dollars](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/anthropic-google-cloud-deal-tpu.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107244923-1684788591875-gettyimages-1251294457-PGONCHAR_7364.jpeg?v=1761251795&w=1920&h=1080)

Google and Anthropic announced a cloud partnership giving Anthropic access to up to 1 million Google Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), a multi-year commitment valued in the tens of billions of dollars. The buildout is expected to bring well over 1 gigawatt of AI compute online in 2026; industry estimates put a 1-GW data center at around $50 billion in total cost, with about $35 billion typically for chips. Google highlighted strong price-performance and efficiency on its seventh‚Äëgeneration ‚ÄúIronwood‚Äù TPU accelerators, calling this Anthropic‚Äôs largest TPU commitment to date. The deal fits Anthropic‚Äôs multi-cloud strategy, where Claude models run across Google TPUs, Amazon Trainium, and Nvidia GPUs, with specific platforms optimized for training, inference, and research.

Anthropic‚Äôs compute needs are rising with rapid revenue and user growth: annual revenue run rate is nearing $7 billion, Claude is used by 300,000+ businesses (300√ó in two years), large $100k+ customers are up ~7√ó year over year, and Claude Code hit a $500 million annualized run rate within two months of launch. Despite the TPU expansion, AWS remains Anthropic‚Äôs primary cloud partner: Amazon has invested $8 billion (vs. Google‚Äôs $3 billion total to date), and Anthropic‚Äôs Project Rainier supercomputer uses Trainium 2 to reduce cost per compute by avoiding premium chip margins. Analysts estimate Anthropic added 1‚Äì2 percentage points to AWS growth in late 2024/early 2025, potentially exceeding 5 points in H2 2025, while Google recently added another $1 billion investment. Anthropic‚Äôs vendor‚Äëneutral stance‚Äîno exclusivity, control of model weights, pricing, and customer data‚Äîhelped ensure resilience during an AWS outage that didn‚Äôt affect Claude, underscoring the benefits of its diversified, execution‚Äëfocused infrastructure approach.

#### [OpenAI‚Äôs AI-powered browser, ChatGPT Atlas, is here](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/803475/openais-ai-powered-browser-chatgpt-atlas-google-chrome-competition-agent)

![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/chatgptatlas.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered web browser now available globally on macOS with Windows, iOS, and Android ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù Atlas features a persistent split-screen ‚Äúcompanion‚Äù that pairs webpages with a live ChatGPT transcript, one-click webpage summarization, and ‚Äúcursor chat‚Äù for in-line edits to selected text. A key differentiator is memory, which stores user-specific context to personalize browsing and can be viewed/managed in settings, plus an incognito mode; an ‚Äúagent mode‚Äù lets ChatGPT take actions like booking reservations or editing documents, currently limited to Plus/Pro users. The product builds on OpenAI‚Äôs prior agentic experiments (Operator, ChatGPT Agent) and follows the company‚Äôs SearchGPT prototype, positioning Atlas against AI-first browsing plays from Perplexity Comet and Google‚Äôs planned Gemini-in-Chrome automations.

Within two days, Microsoft reintroduced Copilot Mode in Edge as an ‚ÄúAI browser,‚Äù adding Actions (form-filling, hotel booking) and Journeys (reasoning over open tabs) to its ride-along assistant that summarizes, compares, and acts across pages with user permission. The UI and workflow strongly echo Atlas, differing mainly in layout (new-tab panel vs split-screen) while hinging on underlying models for capability. Meanwhile, Opera launched Neon, a $19.90/month AI browser that bundles three agents‚ÄîChat (QA/summarization), Do (agentic browsing to complete tasks), and Make (sandboxed tool/app builder)‚Äîplus ‚ÄúCards‚Äù prompt presets; reviewers found Chat verbose and error-prone, Do unreliable and hard to steer mid-task, and Make functional but clunky. Across launches, common themes are agentic actions (booking, form-filling), tab-aware reasoning, built-in summarization, and inline editing‚Äîbut with early-stage reliability, speed, and UX trade-offs that make control, memory management, and clear tool boundaries crucial.

#### [Microsoft‚Äôs Mico is a ‚ÄòClippy‚Äô for the AI era](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/microsofts-mico-is-a-clippy-for-the-ai-era/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mico-1.png?resize=1200,675)

Microsoft introduced Mico, a customizable animated avatar for Copilot that serves as a ‚Äúface‚Äù for the AI assistant, debuting first in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Mico appears during voice mode by default and ‚Äúlistens, reacts, and changes colors,‚Äù can save memories from conversations, and learns from feedback; users can disable it. An Easter egg lets Mico transform into Clippy after repeated taps, embracing the nostalgic comparison. Microsoft also launched ‚ÄúReal Talk,‚Äù a new conversational mode that mirrors a user‚Äôs style while maintaining its own perspective, designed to push back constructively rather than act sycophantically, alongside ‚ÄúLearn Live,‚Äù which tutors users through concepts step by step.

The fall Copilot update adds multi-user chats where you can bring friends into a Copilot conversation, long-term memory, and connectors to pull context from email and cloud storage. Microsoft is expanding Edge into an ‚ÄúAI browser‚Äù that can see open tabs, summarize and compare content, and take actions like booking hotels and autofilling forms, positioning it against ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity‚Äôs Comet, Dia, and Chrome with Gemini. Microsoft says it has improved responses for health-related questions and deep research. While Microsoft frames these features as building trust and reducing screen time, the company acknowledges the challenge of avoiding rabbit holes amid prior reports of chatbot ‚Äúpsychosis.‚Äù

#### Research

[Every Step Evolves: Scaling Reinforcement Learning for Trillion-Scale Thinking Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18855). The team introduces Ring-1T, a trillion-parameter open-source model trained with new systems (IcePop, C3PO++, ASystem) that achieves leading benchmark results and aims to make large-scale reasoning more accessible.

[LLMs Can Get "Brain Rot"!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13928). Researchers find that chronic training on low-quality web text degrades LLMs' reasoning, context retention, safety behaviors, and personality consistency, though instruction tuning and cleaner pretraining can partially restore performance.

[The Coverage Principle: How Pre-Training Enables Post-Training](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.15020). The authors argue that pre-training provides broad coverage of data and tasks, enabling efficient specialization during post-training by leveraging prior representations and reducing the need for task-specific examples.

[How Do LLMs Use Their Depth?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18871). Findings suggest that LLMs make early, high-frequency "guesses" in shallow layers that are progressively refined into context-appropriate predictions in deeper layers, with depth usage varying by token type and task complexity.

[Continual Learning via Sparse Memory Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15103). This method updates only a small subset of memory slots per step‚Äîselected by TF-IDF to rank slots by relevance‚Äîso models can learn from streams of facts or documents without the catastrophic forgetting seen in full or LoRA finetuning.

[Accelerating Vision Transformers with Adaptive Patch Sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18091).
