### Top News

#### [Google created an AI that can generate music from text descriptions, but won’t release it](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/27/google-created-an-ai-that-can-generate-music-from-text-descriptions-but-wont-release-it/)

Summary (written by ChatGPT): Google's new AI system, MusicLM, can create music in any genre by taking a text description as input and generating a coherent song. It was trained on a dataset of 280,000 hours of music and generates songs with significant complexity and a sound that resembles that of a human artist. The system can also be instructed via a description of an image, or generate audio for a specific type of instrument. However, the system is not without flaws, including the use of copyrighted material from its training data, distorted quality in some samples, and poor vocals that range from barely English to gibberish. Google is aware of the ethical challenges posed by MusicLM and has no immediate plans to release it.

Our take: although there have been previous impressive music-generation tools (notably Jukebox by OpenAI), this is a huge advance. The clarity and quality of the sound, minutes-long consistency in the composition, and versatility of this is truly impressive. As the article notes, it is also clearly a sign that musicians will soon face the same dilemmas as visual artists already do due to text-to-image tools being released publicly. Copyright may delay that somewhat, but it's ony a matter of time. 

#### [BuzzFeed says it will use AI tools from OpenAI to personalize its content](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/26/23572834/buzzfeed-using-ai-tools-personalize-generate-content-openai)

Summary: According to a January 26 memo from BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti, the media company plans to use tools from OpenAI to "enhance" and "personalize" its content. BuzzFeed's "A-inspired content" will launch this year: this content could include personalized rom-com pitches for readers. Peretti's memo clearly demonstrates his faith that AI tools are an important part of BuzzFeed's future and his aspiration for BuzzFeed to lead the future of AI-powered content. This news was followed by a significant increase in BuzzFeed's share price.

Our take: First, it's interesting to note the share price reaction to this memo: the news that "we're going to use AI-powered content" alone was apparently enough to send BuzzFeed's share price soaring after a rocky start in the public markets. This does seem an artifact of the clear investor hype we've seen since the release of ChatGPT. It will also be interesting to see how BuzzFeed implements these tools in production. CNET found errors in more than half of a number of articles offering financial advice where it had used AI systems to assist. That being said, BuzzFeed already has extensive experience with AI-assisted curation. Will that expertise translate to creation? We'll have to wait and see.

#### [The best use for AI eye contact tech is making movie stars look straight at the camera](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/26/23572459/ai-eye-contact-tech-nvidia-movie-edit-clips)

Summary: Daniel Hashimoto, a VFX specialist, shared a tweet showing edited movie clips using Nvidia's real-time Eye-Contact feature. The feature is a part of Nvidia's Broadcast software, a video conferencing application that allows for real-time editing of video calls to make the caller appear to be making eye contact with the camera. Hashimoto used the software to make characters in the movie clips directly look at the camera. He is known for his Youtube channel, "Action Movie Kid" and his weekly podcast, "VFX and Chill". He praised the technology as being truly incredible but also commented that the characters staring directly at the camera made the clips look funny.

Our Take: The use of Nvidia's real-time Eye-Contact feature by VFX specialist Daniel Hashimoto highlights the potential of AI in the entertainment industry. The ability to edit the eye gaze of characters during post-production could ease the workload for actors and production teams, as well as reducing the number of takes required. However, as the article and comments on Hashimoto's tweet thread suggest, having characters stare directly into the camera can come across as strange and unnatural. It's not a common thing that humans maintain such prolonged eye contact. Nevertheless, such advancements in technology have the potential to revolutionize the entertainment industry and push the boundaries of what is possible.
