#### [White House Releases AI Action Plan to Cement U.S. Leadership](https://natlawreview.com/article/white-house-reveals-ai-action-plan)
![](https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-07/President%20Donald%20Trump%20White%20House%20Website-211799041.jpg.webp?itok=a56S0EFq)

The White House has released an AI Action Plan titled "Winning the AI Race: America‚Äôs AI Action Plan" to maintain U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence. The plan, which follows President Trump's executive order on Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI, outlines over 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: Accelerating Innovation, Building American AI Infrastructure, and Leading in International Diplomacy and Security. The plan aims to usher in a new era of human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security for the American people.

Key policies in the AI Action Plan include exporting American AI through partnerships between the Commerce and State Departments and industry, promoting rapid buildout of data centers, enabling innovation and adoption by removing federal regulations that hinder AI development, and upholding free speech in frontier models. The plan emphasizes the importance of AI as a revolutionary technology with the potential to transform the global economy and alter the balance of power in the world. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios, AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, and Secretary of State and Acting National Security Advisor Marco Rubio have all expressed their support for the plan and its goals.

#### [OpenAI prepares to launch GPT-5 in August](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257594_NOTEPAD_OPENAI_CVirginia.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

OpenAI is preparing to launch its next-generation model, GPT-5, as early as August, according to sources familiar with the company's plans. The model, which has been spotted in the wild, will be available in mini and nano versions through OpenAI's API. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has described GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of their technology, including the o3 reasoning capabilities. The integration of these capabilities is part of OpenAI's ongoing efforts to simplify and combine its large language models to create a more capable system that can eventually be declared artificial general intelligence (AGI).

The declaration of AGI is significant for OpenAI as it would force Microsoft to relinquish its rights to OpenAI revenue and its future AI models. However, it is unlikely that GPT-5 will meet the AGI threshold linked to OpenAI's profits. The unification of its o-series and GPT-series models will also reduce the friction of having to know which model to pick for each task in ChatGPT. The main combined reasoning version of GPT-5 will be available through ChatGPT and OpenAI‚Äôs API, and the mini version will also be available on ChatGPT and the API. The nano version of GPT-5 is expected to only be available through the API.

#### [Big Tech split? Google to sign EU‚Äôs AI guidelines despite Meta snub](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/big-tech-split-google-to-sign-eus-ai-guidelines-despite-meta-snub.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108125067-1743612093512-gettyimages-2189492700-vcg111536239152.jpeg?v=1743612242&w=1920&h=1080)

Google has announced its intention to sign the European Union's guidelines on artificial intelligence (AI), a move that contrasts with Meta's decision to reject the code due to concerns over potential constraints on European AI innovation. Google believes that the code will enhance European citizens' access to advanced new AI tools as they become available. Kent Walker, president of global affairs at Google, emphasized the importance of prompt and widespread deployment of AI, suggesting that it could boost Europe's economy by 1.4 trillion euros ($1.62 trillion) annually by 2034.

The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, recently published a final version of its code of practice for general-purpose AI models. The code is not mandatory, and companies are free to decide whether or not to sign it. Google's decision to endorse the code indicates its commitment to adhering to the EU's AI guidelines, despite Meta's refusal to do the same.

#### [OpenAI launches Study Mode in ChatGPT](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/openai-launches-study-mode-in-chatgpt/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OpenAI-and-ChatGPT.jpeg?resize=1200,676)

OpenAI has launched a new feature called Study Mode in its AI chatbot, ChatGPT, aimed at fostering critical thinking skills in students. Instead of providing direct answers, the feature prompts users with questions to test their understanding of the material. The feature is being rolled out to users on Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans, with plans to introduce it to Edu subscribers in the coming weeks. The move is a response to concerns that while ChatGPT can be a useful tutoring tool, it may also negatively impact students' critical thinking abilities.

Despite the potential benefits of Study Mode, there are limitations to its effectiveness. Students can easily switch back to the regular mode if they want direct answers, and currently, there are no tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. OpenAI's VP of Education, Leah Belsky, has indicated that the company may consider implementing such controls in the future. The launch of Study Mode is part of OpenAI's broader efforts to improve learning through ChatGPT and the company plans to publish more information on how students use generative AI in their education.
