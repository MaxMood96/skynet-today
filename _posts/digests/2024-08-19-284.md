#### [The AI Scientist: The World‚Äôs First AI System for Automating Scientific Research and Open-Ended Discovery](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/08/14/the-ai-scientist-the-worlds-first-ai-system-for-automating-scientific-research-and-open-ended-discovery/)
![](https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-14-at-5.47.55-PM.png)

The article discusses the development of "The AI Scientist," a groundbreaking AI system designed to automate the entire scientific research process. Developed by researchers from Sakana AI, FLAIR, the University of Oxford, the University of British Columbia, Vector Institute, and Canada CIFAR, the system uses large language models (LLMs) to generate research ideas, conduct experiments, and produce scientific manuscripts autonomously. The AI Scientist operates in three phases: idea generation, experimental iteration, and paper write-up, with each phase leveraging AI tools for efficiency and accuracy. The system has shown promising results, producing research papers that meet or exceed the quality standards of top machine learning conferences, and demonstrating the potential to significantly accelerate the research process. However, the article notes that ongoing refinements will be necessary to enhance its performance, especially in handling more complex, real-world problems.

#### [Google Gemini‚Äôs voice chat mode is here](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219553/google-gemini-live-voice-chat-mode)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u0d7p3jI8uUk-Pel_-elWKAXUso=/0x0:2050x1153/1200x628/filters:focal(1025x577:1026x578)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25570938/Gemini_header_image.png)

Google has introduced a new voice chat mode for its AI assistant, Gemini, named Gemini Live. The feature, which is available for Gemini Advanced subscribers, allows for conversational interaction, including the ability to interrupt the AI mid-sentence or pause the conversation. Gemini Live can also interpret video in real time and function in the background or when the phone is locked. The feature, which is currently available in English for Android devices, will be expanded to iOS and other languages in the coming weeks. Google also announced that Gemini will gain screen context awareness and new extensions for apps like Keep, Tasks, Utilities, and YouTube Music.

#### [xAI‚Äôs Grok can now generate images on X](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/13/xais-grok-can-now-generate-images-on-x/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1771536851.jpg?resize=1200,800)

Elon Musk's company, X, has launched Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini in beta, both of which are AI models capable of generating images on the X social network. However, access to Grok is currently limited to Premium and Premium+ users. The company plans to make both models available to developers through its enterprise API later this month. Despite concerns about the potential misuse of Grok's image-generation feature, particularly in the context of the upcoming U.S. presidential election, there are currently no restrictions on creating images of political figures. The company also plans to deploy Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini in AI-driven features on X, including improved search capabilities, post analytics, and reply functions.

#### [Artists‚Äô lawsuit against Stability AI and Midjourney gets more punch](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219520/stability-midjourney-artist-lawsuit-copyright-trademark-claims-approved)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mx1hFZqiX7KAffJlkHdHHs_6drQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25384195/STK470_AI_LAW_CVIRGINIA_D.jpg)

The lawsuit against AI companies Stability and Midjourney, filed by a group of artists alleging copyright infringement, has gained traction as Judge William Orrick approved additional claims. The artists argue that these companies violated copyright laws by training their AI on a dataset that included their works, and in some cases, allowed users to reproduce copies of their work. The judge allowed a copyright claim against DeviantArt, which used a model based on Stable Diffusion, and Runway AI, the initial startup behind Stable Diffusion. He also approved copyright and trademark infringement claims against Midjourney, which allegedly misled users with a list of artists' names used to generate works in their style. However, the judge dismissed claims that the generators violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and that DeviantArt breached its terms of service. The outcome of the case remains uncertain, as it enters a stage where the artists can request information from the companies in discovery.
