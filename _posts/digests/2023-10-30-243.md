#### [White House to unveil sweeping AI executive order next week, tackling immigration, safety](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/10/25/artificial-intelligence-executive-order-biden/)
![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J6PDA5FBIOQZQO3BTQ7KGCGMPA.JPG&w=1440)

The Biden administration is set to announce a comprehensive executive order on artificial intelligence (AI), marking the U.S. government's most significant attempt to regulate this rapidly evolving technology. The order will require advanced AI models to undergo assessments before federal workers can use them, and it will also ease immigration barriers for highly skilled workers to boost the U.S.'s technological edge. The order comes as the European Union and other governments are working to regulate the riskiest uses of AI. The executive order is expected to build on voluntary commitments signed by 15 companies, including OpenAI, Google, Adobe, and Nvidia, to develop technology to identify AI-generated images and share safety data with the government and academics. The assessments, known as "red teaming," will likely be led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The order also includes provisions to change the immigration process and requires federal agencies to assess the current size of the AI workforce.


#### [Cruise Self-Driving License Revoked After It Withheld Pedestrian Injury Footage, DMV Says](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3ba3/california-dmv-suspends-cruises-self-driving-car-license-after-pedestrian-injury)
![](https://video-images.vice.com/articles/653808a4514be3a56a0b7f2e/lede/1698171046083-gettyimages-1556779089.jpeg?image-resize-opts=Y3JvcD0xeHc6MC44NDI1eGg7MHh3LDAuMDUxN3hoJnJlc2l6ZT0xMjAwOiomcmVzaXplPTEyMDA6Kg)

Cruise, one of the two autonomous vehicle companies offering fully driverless taxi rides in the U.S., has had its license revoked by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The revocation was due to Cruise withholding video footage from an investigation into an incident where a Cruise vehicle ran over a pedestrian and then attempted a "pullover maneuver" while the pedestrian was still underneath the vehicle. The DMV only learned of the full extent of the incident from another government agency. Despite Cruise's spokesperson claiming that they had shown the full video to the DMV, the suspension remains effective immediately. Cruise can still operate in driverless mode but with a safety driver. The company has paused operations on driverless cars in San Francisco as a result of the suspension.


#### [This new data poisoning tool lets artists fight back against generative AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/23/1082189/data-poisoning-artists-fight-generative-ai/)
![](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/poison-corrupts4.jpg?resize=1200,600)

The article discusses a new data poisoning tool, Nightshade, designed to help artists protect their work from being used without consent by generative AI models. The tool, while potentially open to misuse, would require thousands of poisoned samples to significantly impact larger models. Experts, such as Vitaly Shmatikov from Cornell University and Gautam Kamath from the University of Waterloo, highlight the need for robust defenses against such attacks and the importance of addressing vulnerabilities in AI models. The tool is seen as a potential deterrent for AI companies, encouraging them to respect artists' rights and possibly prompting them to pay royalties. Artists, such as Eva Toorenent and Autumn Beverly, express hope that Nightshade will shift the power balance back to the creators, protecting their work from unauthorized use.
