#### [Alibaba touts AI model as better than DeepSeek, OpenAI products, driving stock surge](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3301254/alibaba-touts-ai-model-better-deepseek-openai-products-driving-stock-surge)
![](https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/canvas/2025/03/06/703597bb-33df-4df9-bce5-c7257216ccd3_19fbc510.jpg?itok=_LH4MGcW&v=1741238003)

Alibaba's new AI model, QwQ-32B, has reportedly outperformed DeepSeek's R1 and OpenAI's GPT-4o, despite having significantly fewer parameters (32 billion compared to DeepSeek's 671 billion). This performance has led to an 8.4% surge in Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares. The model's smaller parameter count allows it to operate with less computing resources, making it more accessible for wider adoption. This development aligns with Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai's emphasis on practical applications in AI model development. The QwQ-32B model, a reasoning model designed to solve complex problems, was released less than two months after DeepSeek's R1 made waves in the global tech industry.

Alibaba has announced a new AI model, QwQ 32B, under its Qwen umbrella, which contains 32 billion parameters and is said to perform comparably to DeepSeek-R1, a model with 671 billion parameters. The success of the QwQ 32B model is attributed to the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to foundational models on a large knowledge corpus, and its agentic capabilities that allow for critical thinking based on external feedback. The model, which is available on Hugging Face and ModelScope, outperforms OpenAI’s o1-mini in several benchmarks, including code, mathematical reasoning, and general problem-solving tasks. Alibaba also recently released the Wan 2.1, an open-source video foundation model, and announced plans to invest over $52 billion in the cloud computing and artificial intelligence sector over the next three years.


#### [Judge Denies Musk’s Request to Block OpenAI’s For-Profit Plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/technology/elon-musk-openai-profit-lawsuit.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/03/05/multimedia/05biz-musk-tclz/05biz-musk-tclz-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Elon Musk's request to halt OpenAI's transition from a non-profit to a for-profit entity has been denied by a federal judge in San Francisco. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015, left the organization in 2018 following a power struggle. Despite his departure, the non-profit retained control of the company. However, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has been working on a plan to shift control from the non-profit to the company's investors, effectively transforming it into a for-profit entity. This move is aimed at raising the billions of dollars necessary to develop artificial intelligence technologies.

#### [Alexa Plus’ AI upgrades cost $19.99, but it’s all free with Prime](https://www.theverge.com/news/620005/amazon-alexa-plus-ai-smart-assistant-pricing-availability-devices)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/amazon3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

Amazon has unveiled Alexa Plus, an upgraded version of its smart assistant with enhanced capabilities such as finding concert tickets, ordering Ubers, and facilitating more natural conversations. Early access to Alexa Plus will be available in the United States from late March 2025 for eligible Echo Show device owners, with subscriptions starting at $19.99 per month after the early access period. However, the service will be free for Amazon Prime members. Alexa Plus will be compatible with most existing Alexa devices, with priority given to Echo Show devices during early access, but certain older Echo models and Amazon's Astro robot will not support the new service.
