#### [DeepSeek‚Äôs New AI Model Sparks Shock, Awe, and Questions From US Competitors](https://www.wired.com/story/deepseek-executives-reaction-silicon-valley/)
![](https://media.wired.com/photos/6797a86a2461698d2c47c0b3/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/deepseek-biz-2195594456.jpg)

Chinese startup DeepSeek has developed a powerful open-source artificial intelligence (AI) model, R1, that has caused a stir in Silicon Valley. The model, developed on a small budget, is seen as a sign of a shift in the tech industry towards focusing on advanced capabilities like reasoning, rather than creating larger models that require vast computing resources. This shift has opened opportunities for smaller startups like DeepSeek. The company's technology was developed by a small research lab in China and cost only $5.6 million to build, a fraction of the cost of similar models from competitors like OpenAI. The efficiency of DeepSeek's models has sparked discussions about cost-cutting in big tech firms, with many looking to examine DeepSeek's techniques to reduce their own AI expenditure.

#### [Microsoft loses status as OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/21/microsoft-loses-status-as-openais-exclusive-cloud-provider.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108090153-1737505004480-gettyimages-2194584935-TRUMP_AI.jpeg?v=1737563866&w=1920&h=1080)

Microsoft, the primary investor and cloud partner of OpenAI, is no longer the exclusive provider of computing capacity for the AI startup. Despite this, Microsoft maintains a favorable position, retaining the "right of first refusal" when OpenAI requires additional capacity. This shift in their relationship was revealed during the announcement of the Stargate Project, a joint venture involving OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank, which aims to invest billions in AI infrastructure in the U.S. Oracle, a key initial technology partner, will assist in setting up data center infrastructure. Despite the change, OpenAI will continue to increase its use of Azure, and Microsoft still holds rights to OpenAI's intellectual property.


#### [Microsoft Probing If DeepSeek-Linked Group Improperly Obtained OpenAI Data](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-29/microsoft-probing-if-deepseek-linked-group-improperly-obtained-openai-data)
![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i7RTTIUN8cqc/v0/1200x802.jpg)

Microsoft and OpenAI are currently investigating a potential data breach involving DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence startup. The probe was initiated after Microsoft's security researchers noticed a significant amount of data being extracted via OpenAI's application programming interface (API) in the fall, allegedly by individuals linked to DeepSeek. The API, which developers can license to incorporate OpenAI's proprietary AI models into their own applications, is suspected to have been used in an unauthorized manner to obtain the data. The identities of the individuals involved have not been disclosed due to the confidential nature of the investigation.
