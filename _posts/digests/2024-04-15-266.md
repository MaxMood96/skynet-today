#### [AI Index Report](https://hai.stanford.edu/research/ai-index-report)
![](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2021-10/hai_1.png)

The AI Index Report highlights the rapid advancements in AI technology over the past decade, with systems like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude 3 now able to exceed human performance on standard benchmarks. However, the report also acknowledges the limitations of current AI technology, such as its inability to reliably deal with facts or perform complex reasoning. The report discusses two potential futures for AI: one where technology continues to improve and is increasingly used, and another where the adoption of AI is constrained by its limitations. The AI Index aims to provide objective snapshots of the AI landscape, tracking technical progress, community and investment trends, public opinion, and policy measures. Despite a decrease in global private investment in AI, investment in generative AI has skyrocketed, and AI's impact on worker productivity and legislative proceedings is increasingly recognized.

#### [Texas is replacing thousands of human exam graders with AI](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126206/texas-staar-exam-graders-ai-automated-scoring-engine)

The Texas Education Agency (TEA) is implementing an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered scoring system to grade the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) exams. The system, which uses natural language processing, is expected to save $15-20 million annually by reducing the need for human graders. The AI system was trained using 3,000 exam responses that had already been graded by humans, and safety measures have been put in place, such as having a quarter of all AI-graded results rescored by humans. However, some educators have expressed concerns about the system after a significant increase in zero scores was observed during a limited trial in December 2023.

#### [Is robotics about to have its own ChatGPT moment?](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/04/11/1090718/household-robots-ai-data-robotics/)

The article discusses the potential of robotics in everyday life, focusing on the example of Stretch, a 50-pound robot that can be controlled via a laptop. Stretch, which has a mobile base, a camera, and an adjustable arm with a gripper, was used by a man named Henry Evans for tasks such as brushing his hair and playing with his granddaughter. The robot comes with pre-installed software and AI-enabled navigation, but its main advantage is that users can plug in their own AI models for experimentation. The article suggests that the field of robotics is at a turning point, with robots becoming more competent and useful due to affordable hardware, shared data, and advances in generative AI. However, it also highlights the challenges robots face, such as lack of precise control and coordination, limited understanding of the world due to reliance on cameras and sensors, and a lack of practical physics understanding.
