#### [AI Generated Art Scene Explodes as Hackers Create Groundbreaking New Tools](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7bqj7/ai-generated-art-scene-explodes-as-hackers-create-groundbreaking-new-tools)

A new method for creating art with AI has become popular: just tell an AI model what you want it to draw, and watch it happen. 
The basic technical details are simple: a neural network that can generate images (such as a Generative Adversarial Network, or GAN) is hooked up to a second neural network that can evaluate how well a given image matches with some arbitrary text, and the text you provide is use find an image the first network can generate that is also a good match for your test "prompt". 
While AI models that are able to generate images from text for years have existed for years, the existence of much larger neural networks for both image generation and image-text matching has made has led to this so called VQ-GAN+CLIP approach (named after the two AI models that are typically used) to be able to generate impressively varied and consistently surprising images. 
AI art enthusiasts figured this out over the course of months following OpenAI releasing CLIP earlier this year.

#### [US sanctions a Chinese facial recognition company with Silicon Valley funding](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570225/us-sanctions-chinese-facial-recognition-silicon-valley-funding)

Among the information we have learned about the persecution of the Uighur population in the Chinese province of Xinjiang is the extensive use of surveillance in the region. 
In particular, the Chinese government has teamed up with companies that provide facial recognition software in the development of a real-life panopticon. 
In keeping with US criticism of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the US Department of Commerce moved to sanction 14 Chinese companies linked to the abuses, including DeepGlint, a facial recognition company with ties to Chinese police surveillance and funding from US-based Sequoia Capital (the investment had occurred before the Xinjiang news became public). 
The Commerce Department's Entity List, whose members US companies cannot engage in business without special permission, also includes Sequoia-backed Yitu Technology. 
The sanctions are not focused on China alone: they apply to companies in Iran, Russia, and Canada, among others.

#### [DeepMind's AI for protein structure is coming to the masses](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01968-y)

Last year DeepMind demonstrated AlphaFold 2, a deep learning powered algorithm that can predict protein structures from amino acid sequences much more accurately than what was previously capable.
This software, along with a new comparable algorithm called RoseTTaFold from an academic group, have both been recently released to the public.
The team behind RoseTTaFold has also hosted a free online service to predict protein structures from submitted protein sequences.
Accurate protein structure prediction can enable faster research and development in biotechnologies and potentially drug discovery.
The release of such tools can accelerate research in this area, and in the future similar techniques may be used to solve more complicated problems, like "predicting the structure of complexes of multiple interacting proteins and applying the software to the design of new proteins."
For more on this topic, see our brief from last year covering [AlphaFold 2](https://www.skynettoday.com/briefs/alphafold2).
