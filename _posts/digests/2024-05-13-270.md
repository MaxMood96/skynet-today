### Top News

#### [Google DeepMind‚Äôs new AlphaFold can model a much larger slice of biological life](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/05/08/1092183/google-deepminds-new-alphafold-can-model-a-much-larger-slice-of-biological-life/)

Google's DeepMind has unveiled AlphaFold 3, an advanced version of its protein structure prediction tool, which can now predict the structures of DNA, RNA, and essential drug discovery molecules like ligands. This new tool provides a more detailed and dynamic view of molecular interactions, marking a significant step towards modeling the dynamic systems of biology. AlphaFold 3 is expected to be particularly beneficial for drug discovery, as it can predict where a drug binds a protein, a feature that was absent in its predecessor, AlphaFold 2. However, the tool's effectiveness will depend on the accuracy of its predictions, which, according to Mohammed AlQuraishi, an assistant professor of systems biology at Columbia University, is still very inaccurate for certain uses like protein-RNA interactions.

#### [Rifle-Armed Robot Dogs Now Being Tested By Marine Special Operators](https://www.twz.com/sea/rifle-armed-robot-dogs-now-being-tested-by-marine-special-operators)

The United States Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC) is testing rifle-armed "robot dogs" supplied by Onyx Industries. These robotic canines are equipped with Onyx's SENTRY remote weapon system (RWS) in two calibers: 7.62x39mm and 6.5mm Creedmoor. The underlying robot dog, Ghost Robotics' Vision 60 quadrupedal unmanned ground vehicle (Q-UGV), is designed for tasks such as remote inspection, surveillance, mapping, distributed communications, and persistent security. The autonomous weapon system can scan and detect targets, including drones, people, and vehicles, and alert the operator once a target has been identified, allowing the human to decide whether to engage or not. The system can be operated from anywhere in the world, reducing risk to human operators.

#### [DeepSeek-V2: A Strong, Economical, and Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434v2)


DeepSeek-V2, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model, is presented as a powerful, cost-effective, and efficient tool with 236B total parameters, of which 21B are activated for each token, and a context length of 128K tokens. The model incorporates innovative architectures such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE, which ensure efficient inference by compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector and enable economical training through sparse computation, respectively. Compared to its predecessor, DeepSeek 67B, DeepSeek-V2 offers improved performance, reduces training costs by 42.5%, shrinks the KV cache by 93.3%, and increases the maximum generation throughput by 5.76 times. The model, pretrained on an 8.1T token multi-source corpus and further refined through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), maintains top-tier performance among open-source models, even with only 21B activated parameters.

#### [TikTok will automatically label AI-generated content created on platforms like DALL¬∑E 3](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/09/tiktok-automatically-label-ai-generated-content-created-other-platforms/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2084803237.jpg?resize=1200,675)

TikTok has announced that it will automatically label AI-generated content created on other platforms, such as OpenAI's DALL¬∑E 3, using a technology called Content Credentials from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). This technology attaches specific metadata to content, allowing TikTok to instantly recognize and label AI-generated content. The change, which is rolling out globally, will also apply to content created on platforms that have implemented Content Credentials, including Microsoft's Bing Image Creator. In the coming months, TikTok will also start attaching Content Credentials to AI-generated content created on its own platform. The company views this move as an additional measure to ensure AI-generated content is properly labeled and to alleviate pressure on creators.
