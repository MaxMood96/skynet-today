#### [A Whopping 301 Newly Confirmed Exoplanets – Discovered With New Deep Neural Network ExoMiner](https://scitechdaily.com/a-whopping-301-newly-confirmed-exoplanets-discovered-with-new-deep-neural-network-exominer/)

NASA recently confirmed 301 exoplanets (planets outside the solar system), adding to a total of about 4.5k known to mankind.
Detecting exoplanets is difficult, because they do not emit light and are too far to be directly seen by telescopes.
Instead, researchers need to observe when and how a star's brightness dims, which may indicate a planet passing in front of it.
There are large datasets of star brightness data, but manually parsing and analyzing them takes a lot of time.
To tackle this problem, researchers trained a neural network called ExoMiner to classify potential exoplanet candidates, greatly speeding up the discovery process.
The model is trained on a labeled dataset of observations from the Kepler Space Telescope, and researchers hope to fine-tune the model to observations from other telescopes soon.

**Our take**: It is encouraging and exciting to see AI advances making an impact in science, where analyzing and processing large bulks of data by humans is often impractical. Another famous example that comes to mind is CERN, which is known for using AI to [filter what data to save](http://openlab.cern/sites/default/files/2019-09/Combining%20Big%20Data%20Analytics%20and%20Deep%20Learning%20for%20the%20Large%20Hadron%20Collider%20-%20Intel%20AI.pdf) from its particle collider.


#### [China backs UN pledge to ban (its own) social scoring](https://www.politico.eu/article/china-artificial-intelligence-ai-ban-social-scoring-united-nations-unesco-ethical-ai/)

On Tuesday November 23, UNESCO's 193 member countries approved a first-of-its-kind AI ethics recommendation. The focus is encouraging countries to steer clear of dangerous use cases for AI because of their impacts on human rights. Interestingly, China also signed this document, despite the fact that Beijing has popularized 'social scoring' systems that the document recommends banning. The text also calls on governments to conduct ethical impact assessments and to put in place enforcement mechanisms for protecting human rights.

**Our take**: It is indeed interesting that China signed this bill, and it follows on the heels of Beijing's recent AI ethics recommendations. I think, in terms of increasing its standing in the world, it is in China's interest to engage in developing such principles. It remains to be seen whether Beijing will follow them or not.

The article includes a quotation that I find interesting, and I want to take some time to comment: “Whenever you are not certain that the development of certain technologies is going to have a negative impact but you assume that they might — don’t do it. It’s as simple as that.” I think this statement should not be taken at face value. The development of the Internet itself is something that has had a negative impact, but had we applied this principle then you wouldn't be reading these words right now. There are certainly applications of AI technologies that seem pretty obviously bad, but taking this principle in all instances might mean dismissing applications that will bring both upsides and downsides. I would agree with commentators like Ben Thompson on the idea that the development of technologies like AI and the internet is amoral, and that we need to do a lot more than dismiss a technology as dangerous before deciding to dispense of it. I don't think AI is going to "wreak havoc" on societies or that imagining it will is a useful way to think. If we make decisions based on principles like "this might have negative consequences so let's not develop it," we clearly haven't thought through the issues in nearly enough depth.
