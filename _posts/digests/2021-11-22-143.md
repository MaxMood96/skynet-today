### Top News

#### [Alphabet is putting its prototype robots to work cleaning up around Google’s offices](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791267/alphabet-google-everyday-robot-project-cleaning-office-prototype)

Alphabet has announced that its Everyday Robots Project team has been deploying its robots to carry out custodial tasks on Google’s Bay Area campuses. The team was started at Google X, a division within the company dedicated to ambitious moonshot projects, in 2016. Last week, the company’s chief robots officer put out a [blog post](https://x.company/blog/posts/everyday-robots/) describing their effort to put their robots to work outside of its labs:

> We are now operating a fleet of more than 100 robot prototypes that are autonomously performing a range of useful tasks around our offices. The same robot that sorts trash can now be equipped with a squeegee to wipe tables and use the same gripper that grasps cups can learn to open doors.

The blog post also explains that these robots are trained to do such tasks via machine learning, rather than by being manually programmed. While the approaches they describe are not novel and are being worked on by many AI labs, deploying robots outside these labs among non-researchers has rarely been attempted. Everyday Robots is now doing just that, and it plans to keep expanding these efforts going forward. 

**Our take**: Demonstrating successful robot learning in labs is far easier than in the real world. It’s exciting to see these reports of Everyday Robots seemingly accomplishing that, but it’s hard to say if the solution has been tailor made for Google or if it is general enough for the robots to work in other settings. Regardless, these efforts are still prototypes, and I would not be surprised if it takes a decade or more for this technology to be commercialized.

#### [A Utah company says it’s revolutionized truth-telling technology. Experts are highly skeptical.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/15/lie-detector-eye-movements-converus/)

EyeDetect, by Utah company Converus, claims to be able to tell whether someone is lying from their eye movements. While the creators claim the system has an accuracy rate of between 83 and 87 percent, experts are skeptical. Critics claim that human truth-telling is too subtle for any dataset--relying on such a system could result in unjust outcomes.

**Our take**: I feel like some AI systems today are reminding me of the sort-of joke that you can find a [correlation between literally any two things](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations). There are genuine causal claims behind many of the things prediction systems do, but indulging in the idea that we can predict anything from anything fabricates causal claims out of nothing. You can train a machine learning system to accurately predict some dependent variable from an independent variable that is in fact quite unrelated because you have the data to do so. The developers even make the claim that "by entirely automating the test, it avoids the possibility of human bias" (and we all know how accurate of a statement that is). As the article points out, this system in particular feels like the sort with dystopian implications even if it does work well. I think there are a lot of potentially beneficial AI systems that might be troublesome if not implemented correctly. This seems to be one that isn't good news, whether it works or not.
