OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence (AI) lab, has announced a $6.5 billion all-stock deal to acquire IO, a start-up founded by Jony Ive, a former top Apple executive known for designing the iPhone. The deal aims to create a new range of products for the era of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a future technology that is expected to achieve human-level intelligence. This move is seen as an attempt to transition AI from being primarily an app-based technology to being integrated into everyday physical devices.

The acquisition of IO by OpenAI is a significant step in the evolution of AI technology. Despite the profound impact AI has had on the technology world, changing how software is created, information is searched, and images and videos are generated, it has largely remained confined to apps on phones. This deal, which brings together two major figures in the tech industry, is intended to solve this issue and bring AI into the realm of physical gadgets.

Google's I/O 2025 conference was packed with AI-related announcements, including updates to its image and video generation models, new features in Search and Gmail, and the introduction of a new AI filmmaking app. The company is rolling out AI Mode, a new feature that allows users to search the web using Google's Gemini AI chatbot. This feature will be tested with new capabilities such as deep search and chart generation for finance and sports queries. Google also announced updates to Project Starline, which is evolving into Google Beam, a 3D video chat tool that will be incorporated into an HP-branded device. Companies like Deloitte, Duolingo, and Salesforce have already committed to adding Google Beam devices to their offices.

Google also unveiled Imagen 4, the latest version of its AI text-to-image generator, and Veo 3, a next-gen AI video generator. A new AI filmmaking app called Flow was launched, which uses Veo, Imagen, and Gemini to create short AI-generated video clips. Google is also working on Project Aura, a new pair of smart glasses that use the Android XR platform for mixed-reality devices. The glasses will feature Gemini integration and a large field-of-view. Google's AI assistant will be integrated into Chrome, allowing users to clarify or summarize information across webpages and navigate sites. Lastly, Google is launching a new "AI Ultra" subscription that offers access to the company's most advanced AI models and higher usage limits across apps like Gemini, NotebookLM, Flow, and more.

Google has unveiled its latest video-generating AI model, Veo 3, at the Google I/O 2025 developer conference. The model is capable of creating sound effects, background noises, and dialogue to accompany the videos it generates, marking a significant improvement over its predecessor, Veo 2. Veo 3 is available in Googleâ€™s Gemini chatbot app for subscribers to Googleâ€™s $249.99-per-month AI Ultra plan. The model can be prompted with text or an image to generate videos. Google's CEO of DeepMind, Demis Hassabis, highlighted that Veo 3 can understand raw pixels from its videos and sync generated sounds with clips automatically.

Veo 3's development was likely facilitated by DeepMind's previous work in "video-to-audio" AI, which involved training a model on a combination of sounds, dialogue transcripts, and video clips. While the source of the content used to train Veo 3 is not disclosed, YouTube, owned by Google, is a probable candidate. To counter the risk of deepfakes, DeepMind is using its proprietary watermarking technology, SynthID, to embed invisible markers into frames generated by Veo 3. Google also announced new capabilities for Veo 2, including a feature that allows users to provide the model with images of characters, scenes, objects, and styles for better consistency. These new features will be available on Google's Vertex AI API platform in the coming weeks.
