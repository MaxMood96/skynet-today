#### [AI generates high-quality images 30 times faster in a single step](https://news.mit.edu/2024/ai-generates-high-quality-images-30-times-faster-single-step-0321)

Researchers at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a new framework that accelerates the image generation process of diffusion models by 30 times. The framework, known as distribution matching distillation (DMD), simplifies the multi-step process of traditional diffusion models into a single step, while maintaining the quality of the generated images. DMD uses a teacher-student model, teaching a new computer model to mimic the behavior of more complex, original models that generate images. The new model, which is capable of producing high-quality images, could potentially support advancements in fields such as drug discovery and 3D modeling. The DMD framework was tested against traditional methods and showed consistent performance, achieving state-of-the-art one-step generation performance.


#### [New York City welcomes robotaxis ‚Äî but only with safety drivers](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/28/24108894/nyc-autonomous-robotaxi-safety-driver-permit-eric-adams)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9far6avT34ao5aLuhDaaYkZFf_A=/0x0:2560x1440/1200x628/filters:focal(1280x720:1281x721)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3924522/city-scape.0.jpg)

New York City has introduced a new permitting system for autonomous vehicle testing, with a key requirement that a human safety driver must be present at all times. The system is designed to ensure that only companies with prior autonomous vehicle testing experience can apply, and they must provide data from previous tests, including any accidents and instances where safety drivers had to intervene. The city aims to avoid issues experienced in other cities, such as San Francisco, where driverless vehicles have caused traffic obstructions and safety concerns. As part of the application process, companies must also detail their safety driver hiring and training practices, and affirm adherence to best practices from the Society of Automotive Engineers.

#### [OpenAI built a voice cloning tool, but you can‚Äôt use it‚Ä¶ yet](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/29/openai-custom-voice-engine-preview/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/openAI-pattern-04.jpg?resize=1200,675)

OpenAI has previewed its Voice Engine, a tool that can clone voices using a 15-second voice sample. The technology, which has been in development for two years, is an expansion of OpenAI's existing text-to-speech API and is already used in the company's AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT. The Voice Engine model was trained on a mix of licensed and publicly available data, but the company is currently facing a lawsuit over allegations of IP law violation by training its AI on copyrighted content. The tool is not yet available to the public, as OpenAI wants to ensure it is deployed responsibly and has safeguards against misuse. The company is also exploring how the technology could impact the voice actor economy.
