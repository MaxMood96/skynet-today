#### [DeepMind discovers that AI large language models can optimize their own prompts](https://venturebeat.com/business/deepmind-discovers-that-ai-large-language-models-can-optimize-their-own-prompts/)
![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cfr0z3n_two_different_robots_in_a_garage._one_robot_holds_tools_db8e498a-83f3-4ac1-955b-b62a25b19298.png?w=1200&strip=all)

DeepMind researchers have proposed a new method called Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO) that uses AI large language models (LLMs) as optimizers. Unlike traditional methods that rely on formal mathematical definitions, OPRO defines optimization tasks in natural language. The process begins with a "meta-prompt" that includes a task description and examples of problems and solutions. The LLM then generates candidate solutions based on this information, which are evaluated and assigned a quality score. The best solutions are added to the meta-prompt for the next round of solution generation. This method allows for a wide array of problems to be solved by simply modifying the problem description or adding specific instructions. The researchers found that OPRO can sometimes match or even surpass the performance of expert-designed heuristic algorithms on small-scale optimization problems. The true potential of OPRO lies in its ability to optimize LLM prompts to get maximum accuracy from the models.

#### [Paper: LLMs trained on ‚ÄúA is B‚Äù fail to learn ‚ÄúB is A‚Äù](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SCqDipWAhZ49JNdmL/paper-llms-trained-on-a-is-b-fail-to-learn-b-is-a)

The article discusses a study on Language Models (LLMs) and their inability to learn the concept of symmetry, specifically in the context of "A is B" not necessarily implying "B is A". The paper, titled "LLMs trained on 'A is B' fail to learn 'B is A'", explores this phenomenon, referred to as the "reversal curse". The study reveals that despite being trained on a large amount of data, LLMs struggle to understand this basic logical concept, which raises questions about their ability to comprehend more complex logical relationships. The paper suggests further research to improve LLMs' understanding of such fundamental principles.

The article discusses the increasing use of generative AI in education, despite concerns about its potential impact on the teaching profession. The AI Education Project, funded by Google, Intel, and OpenAI, has trained over 7,000 teachers in AI usage, with generative AI commonly used for lesson planning and parent communication. However, some teachers worry about the ethical implications of automating parts of their job and fear job displacement due to AI. Despite skepticism due to past disappointments with edtech, experts like Joseph South from the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) insist that AI in education is not a passing fad. The Charter School Growth Fund has formed working groups to advise on AI policy, emphasizing the need to monitor the quality of AI-generated content.
