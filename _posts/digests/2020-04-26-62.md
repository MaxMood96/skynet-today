### Mini Briefs

#### [MIT Cuts Ties With a Chinese AI Firm Amid Human Rights Concerns](https://www.wired.com/story/mit-cuts-ties-chinese-ai-firm-human-rights/)

iFlytek, a Chinese AI firm established in 1999, has made headlines worldwide in the last few years for its work on speech technology. MIT announced a five-year collaboration with iFlytek in June 2018, and since then the Chinese firm has helped fund projects focused on areas including human computer interaction and applied voice recognition. But such arrangements have become tricky as US-China relations have become more tense. In an even more concerning turn, iFlytek was accused of supplying technology for surveilling Muslim Uighurs, a group that is known to be facing sever persecution by the Chinese government, in Xinjiang Province. In the wake of tightened guidelines regarding funding from Chinese companies, MIT ended the collaboration, although the institution did not specify its reasons. 


#### [AI can tackle the climate emergency - if developed responsibly](https://theconversation.com/ai-can-tackle-the-climate-emergency-if-developed-responsibly-132908)

Although the world is focused on the coronavirus pandemic, we will do well not to forget that there is still another major challenge ahead of us that promises to do significant damage if we refuse to do anything about it. At the same time, our technological progress in this new decade stands on the shoulders of giants, due to the immense progress in AI we have seen in the 2010s. As a result of this progress, AI shows promise in helping us confront the climate challenge by helping us understand how people use cities to inform urban planning and design products that can be more easily recycled. While it's easy to be starry-eyed about what large corporations such as Microsoft can (and are already starting to) do at this intersection, AI bias still presents an important issue that will need to be tackled in the process of developing responsible AI systems to respond to climate change.
