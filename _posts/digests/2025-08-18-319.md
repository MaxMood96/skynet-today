OpenAI has begun rolling out GPT-5 across ChatGPT with multiple variants and aggressive pricing, pitching it as ‚Äúsmarter, faster, more useful, and more accurate,‚Äù with notably reduced hallucinations. Users on free/Plus get GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini, while Pro ($200/month) adds GPT-5-pro and GPT-5-thinking; the chat UI now auto-routes to the ‚Äúright‚Äù model by task and tier. API pricing lands at $1.25/1M input and $10/1M output tokens (mini: $0.25/$2; nano API-only: $0.05/$0.40), undercutting Anthropic Opus 4.1 ($15/$75) and even beating many Google Gemini Flash tiers at scale; cached input is $0.125/1M. Fresh features include Gmail/Contacts/Calendar integrations (starting with Pro next week), preset personalities (Cynic/Robot/Listener/Nerd) and chat color options, with plans to fold personalities into Advanced Voice Mode.

The debut was rocky. OpenAI removed legacy models (e.g., GPT-4o, 4.1, o3) without notice, routed most users through an autoswitcher that partially broke on day one, and drew criticism for a ‚Äúchart crime‚Äù in its live deck. Altman apologized, doubled Plus rate limits, and brought 4o back for paid users. A model picker has since returned with GPT-5 modes‚ÄîAuto, Fast, and Thinking‚Äîand access to select legacy models (4o is default; others via settings). Rate limits for GPT-5 Thinking now reach up to 3,000 messages/week, with fallback to a Thinking-mini tier. Early comparisons suggest GPT-5-Thinking and GPT-5-Pro significantly reduce hallucinations and improve writing and long-form reasoning, while base GPT-5 (‚ÄúFast‚Äù) looks closer to GPT-4o and can still be somewhat sycophantic; many developers report strong coding performance and competitive ‚Äúintelligence per dollar.‚Äù Despite OpenAI‚Äôs ‚Äúbest model‚Äù messaging, external tests show mixed benchmark wins versus Anthropic, Google, and xAI. The low pricing could still spark an LLM price war. User backlash over personality and workflow changes prompted OpenAI to add more transparency, customization, and options, with rapid day-by-day iteration continuing.

#### [Companies Are Pouring Billions Into A.I. It Has Yet to Pay Off.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/13/business/ai-business-payoff-lags.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/12/business/00biz-ai-lag/00biz-ai-lag-facebookJumbo.jpg)

A new ‚Äúproductivity paradox‚Äù is emerging around generative AI: despite massive adoption, measurable business gains remain elusive. McKinsey finds roughly 80% of companies say they use generative AI, yet a similar share see no significant bottom-line impact. Firms expected tools like ChatGPT to streamline back-office and customer service work, but hallucinations, unreliable outputs, and integration headaches are slowing ROI. Outside tech, enthusiasm has outpaced the ability to translate pilots into production-grade, cost-saving deployments.

Costs and complexity are key culprits. Implementation is expensive, data quality and governance are hard, and human oversight to verify AI outputs blunts efficiency gains. Many deployments stay narrow or experimental, limiting enterprise-wide effects. Companies also grapple with model brittleness, compliance and security risks, and the need to redesign workflows‚Äîa change-management lift that takes time. As with the PC era, the tech‚Äôs potential is clear, but tangible efficiency gains will likely come from better reliability, domain-specific tuning, and deeper process integration rather than surface-level chatbots.

#### [Anthropic takes aim at OpenAI, offers Claude to ‚Äòall three branches of government‚Äô for $1](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/anthropic-takes-aim-at-openai-offers-claude-to-all-three-branches-of-government-for-1/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159671948.jpg?resize=1200,800)

Anthropic will offer Claude for $1 for one year to all three branches of the U.S. government‚Äîexecutive, legislative, and judicial‚Äîescalating OpenAI‚Äôs $1 ChatGPT Enterprise offer to the federal executive branch. The company will provide both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government, the latter supporting FedRAMP High workloads for sensitive but unclassified data. Emphasizing ‚Äúuncompromising security standards,‚Äù Anthropic cites certifications and integrations that let agencies access Claude via existing secure infrastructure through AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir. It will also supply technical support to help agencies integrate Claude into workflows.

Key technical and deployment details:
- FedRAMP High certification for Claude for Government; OpenAI‚Äôs current FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud, while Anthropic offers multicloud access (AWS, Google Cloud, Palantir), potentially aiding data sovereignty and operational flexibility.
- GSA-approved vendor status alongside OpenAI and Google DeepMind allows sales to civilian federal agencies; the $1 offer extends to legislative and judicial branches as well.
- Existing government use cases include Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (accelerating scientific discovery) and DC Department of Health (multilingual resident services).
- Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, and Google were granted up to $200M by the DoD for national security AI, and OpenAI is working to reduce reliance on Azure to diversify infrastructure.

#### [Goodbye, $165,000 Tech Jobs. Student Coders Seek Work at Chipotle.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/technology/coding-ai-jobs-students.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/28/multimedia/AI-jobs-Mishra-01-cjwl/AI-jobs-Mishra-01-cjwl-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg)

A boom in computer science education over the past decade is colliding with a sharply tighter tech job market, as AI coding tools and widespread layoffs reduce demand for entry-level programmers. After years of promotion from tech leaders‚Äîlike Microsoft‚Äôs 2012 push touting $100,000+ starting salaries, $15,000 signing bonuses, and $50,000 in stock grants‚Äîundergraduate CS majors in the U.S. more than doubled to over 170,000 by 2023, per the Computing Research Association. Recent layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta, and Microsoft, coupled with AI assistants that can generate thousands of lines of code, have cooled hiring. Viral anecdotes, such as a new CS grad only getting an interview at Chipotle, underscore a broader drop-off in entry-level software roles.

Generative AI is reshaping the entry-level landscape by automating routine coding tasks junior engineers traditionally handled. Paired with corporate belt-tightening, this has meant fewer interviews and offers, pushing new grads to widen their searches beyond tech or accept non-technical jobs. The reversal is stark given the long-running narrative that coding guaranteed a ‚Äúgolden ticket‚Äù to high-paying work with rich perks. While the piece centers on immediate employment headwinds, the drivers are clear: AI-enabled code generation and sustained big-tech layoffs are depressing demand just as the supply of CS graduates hits record highs.

[Part I: Tricks or Traps? A Deep Dive into RL for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08221). A systematic reproduction and analysis across consistent setups finds many common RL techniques for LLM reasoning are highly sensitive to model, data, and reward design, and that a minimal combination‚Äîadvantage normalization (group mean, batch std) plus token-level loss aggregation‚Äîoften suffices to enable critic-free PPO to outperform more complex RL4LLM methods.

[Diffusion LLMs Can Do Faster-Than-AR Inference via Discrete Diffusion Forcing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09192). Training diffusion LLMs with a new discrete diffusion forcing (D2F) procedure and asymmetric distillation allows blocks to be denoised in parallel with block-wise causal attention and KV caching, enabling pipelined decoding that yields up to 2.5√ó faster open-source inference than comparable autoregressive models on math and coding benchmarks.
