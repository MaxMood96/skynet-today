#### [Cerebras' Tech Trains 'Brain-Scale" AIs](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cerebras-ai-computers)

At this year's IEEE Hot Chips conference, Cerebras Systems unveiled their new neural network training systems.
The new system consists of four parts that together will enable linear imporvements in network training speed as more chips are added, and it can in theory train networks with as many as 120 trillion parameters.
To put that in perspective, GPT-3 has only 175 billion parameters.
Three of the four parts are hardware improvements that allow Cerebras to efficiently stream large amounts of network parameters and data to their large compute chips, each with 40GB of on-chip memory.
The other improvement has to do with taking better advantage of sparsity in many neural networks --- avoiding doing computations whose results are easily known (like multiplying by zeros).
These developments pave a way for bigger and more complex AI training systems in the future, potentially achieving "brain-scale" compute, which many put at the scale of 100 trillion parameters.

#### [“Flying in the Dark”: Hospital AI Tools Aren’t Well Documented](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/flying-dark-hospital-ai-tools-arent-well-documented)

Generalization is a well-known issue in machine learning: can a model trained on a particular dataset generalize to unseen data?
How will it perform in the "real world?" The answer, for hospital models, is not so good. 
University of Michigan researchers found that a widely used artificial intelligence model for spotting early signs of sepsis missed about two-thirds of actual cases and raised many false alarms. 
Delving into the broader problem, a new (and not yet peer-reviewed) study from Stanford researchers reveals that AI models in healthcare are not documented with anywhere near the rigor or accuracy deemed necessary by medical and AI professionals. 
90% of the models examined, all developed by EPIC systems, did adhere to a dozen of the most common recommendations for documentation. 
But "the models complied with barely 40 percent of the total 220 individual recommendations across all 15 guidelines." 
As with models more generally, it seems that medical AI systems could do with a dose of transparency.
