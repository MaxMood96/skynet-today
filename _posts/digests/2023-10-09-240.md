#### [Decomposing Language Models Into Understandable Components](https://www.anthropic.com/index/decomposing-language-models-into-understandable-components)
![](https://efficient-manatee.transforms.svdcdn.com/production/images/Untitled-Artwork-11.png?w=1200&h=630&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1696477668&s=fe41beb80074843426e455ad571ac77f)

The article discusses a new approach to understanding the complex behaviors of neural networks, particularly language models, by decomposing them into more understandable components called features. These features, unlike individual neurons, have consistent relationships to network behavior and represent specific patterns of neuron activations. The researchers have developed a method to identify these features in small transformer models, which can represent a wide range of elements such as DNA sequences, legal language, HTTP requests, and more. The interpretability of these features was validated through human evaluation and an "autointerpretability" approach, where a large language model generates descriptions of the small model's features. The researchers also found that artificially activating a feature can predictably change the model's behavior. The features learned are largely universal between different models, suggesting that insights gained from one model could be applied to others.

#### [Scaling GAIA-1: 9-billion parameter generative world model for autonomous driving](https://wayve.ai/thinking/scaling-gaia-1/)
![](https://wayve.ai/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wayve-GAIA-1-Tech-Blog-Thumbnail.jpg)

GAIA-1 is a 9-billion parameter generative world model designed for autonomous driving. It uses specialized encoders for video, text, and action inputs, projecting them into a shared representation. The core component of GAIA-1 is an autoregressive transformer, the world model, which predicts the next set of image tokens in a sequence, considering past image tokens and contextual information from text and action tokens. The video decoder, a video diffusion model, translates these predicted image tokens back into pixel space, ensuring the generated videos are semantically meaningful, visually accurate, and temporally consistent. GAIA-1's training dataset consists of 4,700 hours of proprietary driving data collected in London, UK, between 2019 and 2023. The model's formulation closely resembles large language models, with similar scaling laws applying. The performance of GAIA-1's world model shows significant room for improvement with scaling data and compute.

#### [Introducing Stable LM 3B: Bringing Sustainable, High-Performance Language Models to Smart Devices](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-lm-3b-sustainable-high-performance-language-models-smart-devices)
![](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/6213c340453c3f502425776e/62f2452bc121595f4d87c713/651a94b567d2f408ccc35e61/1696266811144/Stable+LM+3B+-+Cover+Image.jpg?format=1500w)

Stability AI has launched an experimental version of Stable LM 3B, a compact, high-performance generative AI solution with 3 billion parameters, designed for portable digital devices. The model's smaller size and efficiency make it more affordable and environmentally friendly, as it requires fewer resources and consumes less power. Despite its size, Stable LM 3B outperforms previous 3B parameter language models and some 7B parameter open-source models. The model's development expands the range of applications viable on edge devices or home PCs, enabling the development of technologies with strong conversational capabilities. Stable LM 3B has improved performance on common natural language processing benchmarks and can be fine-tuned for alternative uses, such as programming assistance. However, as a base model, it needs to be adjusted for safe performance in specific applications. The model is available for download on the Hugging Face platform under the open-source CC-By-SA 4.0 license.
