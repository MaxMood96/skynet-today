### Top News

[I tested Google Bard. It was surprising -- in a bad way](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-google-bard-it-was-surprising-in-a-bad-way/)

**Summary**: The author is underwhelmed by Google's Bard due its limited functions, knowledge, and features. Bard takes longer to generate answers than ChatGPT and Bing Chat, and it struggles to answer straightforward questions. Additionally, unlike Bing Chat, Google Bard does not provide sources for its answers. On the other hand, Google Bard does excel in career-building tools, such as generating resume content and proofreading text, so it remains a useful text editor and generator for tasks like composing cover letters and essays. However, overall, ChatGPT and Bing Chat seem to be more capable chatbots. It should be noted that Google Bard is in its early stages and is expected to improve over time, as it will be updated with newer and more capable models.

**Our take**: It is surprising that Bard is so much worse than ChatGPT, given that Google was first to create such a chatbot with last year's [LaMDA](https://lastweekin.ai/p/lamdas-sentience-is-nonsense-heres), which is based on very similar techniques to ChatGPT. It may well be that Google is proceeding very carefully to avoid any PR missteps, and as a result Bard is overly constrained. Overall, this is pretty embarassing for Google. Still, as with ChatGPT it is a very powerful tool for all sorts of things, and is likely to improve rapidly.


[OpenAI is massively expanding ChatGPT’s capabilities to let it browse the web and more](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23653591/openai-chatgpt-plugins-launch-web-browsing-third-party)

**Summary**: OpenAI is introducing plug-in support for ChatGPT, greatly expanding its capabilities and allowing access to live data from the web for the first time. This upgrade will enable ChatGPT to browse the internet and interact with specific websites, potentially transforming it into a comprehensive interface for various services and sites. Initially, 11 plug-ins for external sites such as Expedia, OpenTable, Kayak, Klarna Shopping, and Zapier will be available to a select group of users. These plug-ins allow ChatGPT not only to retrieve real-time information but also to connect to APIs and perform actions on behalf of users. OpenAI has implemented safeguards to address safety and security concerns and will initially prioritize a small number of developers and ChatGPT Plus users for plug-in access.

**Our take**: This is a big deal. ChatGPT's inability to access new information and interface with various parts of the web had been its biggest limitation, and that is now gone. Moreover, this being a framework for adding arbitrary plug-ins means ChatGPT can be integrated into just about anything, and will likely soon be part of all sorts of websites and applications. 

#### [People Aren’t Falling for AI Trump Photos (Yet)](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/03/ai-generated-fake-trump-indictment-images/673513/)

**Summary**: If you've spent much time on social media recently, you've probably seen a number of photos depicting the arrest of Donald Trump. Images show him running away from police and being detained. These images are not real. With the impending possibility of a Trump indictment, Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins asked the latest version of Midjourney to illlustrate the spectacle of a Trump arrest. The vivid photos paint a full story arc: from Trump Jr. and Melania Trump screaming at officers to Trump's eventual escape from prison.
Only the scene of Trump's arrest went viral—but despite widespread and not-entirely-new concerns about misinformation, most people who saw the images were not fooled. But we're not all immune to misinformation. Chris Moran, head of editorial innovation at The Guardian was contacted by a researcher asking why the paper had deleted an article from its archive—this article did not exist, but was hallucinated entirely by ChatGPT. As The Atlantic concludes, we can't prognosticate much except to say that things are likely to get weird.

**Our Take**: I recently spoke to Irene Solaiman (episode isn't released yet), who directs AI policy at HuggingFace, about concerns like deepfake-powered misinformation campaigns. While some of the mass misinformation campaigns researchers worried about have not come to pass, red-teaming and understanding what negative scenarios for modern technologies look like is a useful exercise.
There's no doubt that AI systems could complicate our sense of reality, but it's hard to know exactly what that will look like. Exercises like understanding the implications of and possible mitigation strategies for misinformation campaigns and similar problems is a useful exercise. If these things do come to pass, even if not in the form we expected, someone will have thought about how they will play out and what to do.
