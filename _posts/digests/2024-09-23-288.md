Lionsgate, a major Hollywood studio, has announced a pioneering partnership with AI research company Runway to develop an AI model that can generate "cinematic video" and potentially replace storyboard artists and VFX crews. The model will be trained on Lionsgate's extensive portfolio of film and TV content, with the aim of saving "millions and millions of dollars" in production costs. Lionsgate's vice chairman, Michael Burns, envisions the AI tool being used to create backgrounds and special effects, and believes it will offer "cutting-edge, capital-efficient content creation opportunities." However, the move has sparked controversy, with Runway currently facing a lawsuit from a group of visual artists for copyright infringement.

San Francisco-based startup Luma AI has announced an application programming interface (API) for its Dream Machine video generation model, intensifying the competition in the AI video technology sector. The Dream Machine API allows users, including individual software developers, startup founders, and engineers at larger enterprises, to build applications and services using Luma's video generation model. The API is powered by the latest version of Dream Machine (v1.6) and offers advanced video generation tools such as text-to-video, image-to-video, keyframe control, video extension and looping, camera motion control, and variable aspect ratios. The API is priced at $0.32 per million pixels generated, making it accessible to smaller developers. Luma AI also introduced a "Scale" option for larger companies and organizations, providing higher rate limits and personalized onboarding and engineering support.

![](https://www.maginative.com/content/images/size/w1200/2024/09/1X-World-Model.jpg)

Norwegian startup 1X Technologies has developed an AI-based world model to serve as a virtual simulator for training robots, addressing the challenge of reliably evaluating multi-task robots in dynamic environments. The company used machine learning to train these models on thousands of hours of video footage, enabling the models to predict how objects and environments would respond to different robotic actions and generate realistic visual simulations. Despite some limitations, such as occasional inconsistencies in object coherence and unrealistic object behavior, the models can handle complex interactions and generate multiple potential outcomes from the same initial conditions. To encourage further research and innovation, 1X Technologies has launched the "1X World Model Challenge," offering data, pre-trained models, and cash prizes.
