#### [White House Releases AI Action Plan to Cement U.S. Leadership](https://natlawreview.com/article/white-house-reveals-ai-action-plan)
![](https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-07/President%20Donald%20Trump%20White%20House%20Website-211799041.jpg.webp?itok=a56S0EFq)

The White House has released an AI Action Plan titled "Winning the AI Race: America‚Äôs AI Action Plan" to maintain U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence. The plan, which follows President Trump's executive order on Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI, outlines over 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: Accelerating Innovation, Building American AI Infrastructure, and Leading in International Diplomacy and Security. The plan aims to usher in a new era of human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security for the American people.

Key policies in the AI Action Plan include exporting American AI through a partnership between the Commerce and State Departments and industry, promoting rapid buildout of data centers, enabling innovation and adoption by removing federal regulations that hinder AI development, and upholding free speech in frontier models. The plan emphasizes the importance of AI as a revolutionary technology with the potential to transform the global economy and alter the balance of power in the world. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios, AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, and Secretary of State and Acting National Security Advisor Marco Rubio have all expressed their support for the plan and its goals.

#### [OpenAI prepares to launch GPT-5 in August](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257594_NOTEPAD_OPENAI_CVirginia.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

OpenAI is preparing to launch its next-generation model, GPT-5, as early as August, following some delays. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has hinted at the capabilities of GPT-5, describing it as a system that integrates a lot of their technology. The model will include the o3 reasoning capabilities, as part of OpenAI's efforts to simplify and combine its large language models to create a more capable system. The launch of GPT-5 is significant as it is a step towards achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), a goal that would force Microsoft to relinquish its rights to OpenAI revenue and future AI models.

GPT-5 will be available in mini and nano versions through OpenAI's API. The main combined reasoning version of GPT-5 will be available through ChatGPT and OpenAI‚Äôs API, and the mini version will also be available on ChatGPT and the API. The nano version of GPT-5 is expected to only be available through the API. However, OpenAI's planned release dates often shift due to development challenges, server capacity issues, or rival AI model announcements and leaks. OpenAI is also preparing to launch an open language model, similar to o3 mini, before the end of July, ahead of GPT-5‚Äôs release.

#### [Big Tech split? Google to sign EU‚Äôs AI guidelines despite Meta snub](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/big-tech-split-google-to-sign-eus-ai-guidelines-despite-meta-snub.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108125067-1743612093512-gettyimages-2189492700-vcg111536239152.jpeg?v=1743612242&w=1920&h=1080)

Google has announced its intention to sign the European Union's guidelines on artificial intelligence (AI), a move that contrasts with Meta's decision to reject the same guidelines due to concerns over potential constraints on AI innovation. Google's decision is driven by the belief that the guidelines will enhance European citizens' access to advanced AI tools as they become available. The company's endorsement of the guidelines comes after Meta's refusal to sign, citing concerns that the code could stifle European AI innovation.

The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, has published a final version of its code of practice for general-purpose AI models, leaving the decision to sign up to individual companies. Google's President of Global Affairs, Kent Walker, emphasized the importance of prompt and widespread deployment of AI, suggesting that embracing AI could boost Europe's economy by 1.4 trillion euros ($1.62 trillion) annually by 2034.

#### [OpenAI launches Study Mode in ChatGPT](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/openai-launches-study-mode-in-chatgpt/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OpenAI-and-ChatGPT.jpeg?resize=1200,676)

OpenAI has launched a new feature called Study Mode in its AI tool, ChatGPT, aimed at fostering critical thinking skills among students. Instead of providing direct answers, the tool will pose questions to test users' understanding of the material. The feature is being rolled out to users on Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans, with plans to introduce it to Edu subscribers in the coming weeks. The move is a response to concerns that while ChatGPT can be a useful tutor, it may also negatively impact students' critical thinking abilities.

Despite the potential benefits of Study Mode, there are limitations to its effectiveness. Students can easily switch back to the regular mode if they want direct answers, and currently, there are no tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. OpenAI's VP of Education, Leah Belsky, has indicated that the company may consider implementing such controls in the future. The launch of Study Mode is part of OpenAI's broader efforts to improve the learning capabilities of ChatGPT and to better understand how students use generative AI in their education.
