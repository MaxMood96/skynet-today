#### [Anthropic endorses California‚Äôs AI safety bill, SB 53](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/anthropic-endorses-californias-ai-safety-bill-sb-53/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1968430987.jpg?resize=1200,799)

Anthropic officially endorsed California‚Äôs SB 53, a frontier AI safety bill from Sen. Scott Wiener that would impose transparency and safety requirements on the largest AI developers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI. The bill would mandate developers to create safety frameworks and publish public safety and security reports prior to deploying ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù models, and it adds whistleblower protections for employees raising safety concerns. SB 53 targets ‚Äúcatastrophic risks,‚Äù defined as events causing at least 50 deaths or over $1 billion in damages, focusing on preventing models from enabling biological weapons development or cyberattacks rather than issues like deepfakes. While Anthropic says it prefers federal standards, it argues progress can‚Äôt wait; co-founder Jack Clark called SB 53 a ‚Äúsolid blueprint for AI governance.‚Äù

A prior version has already passed the California Senate; a final vote is pending before the bill can go to Governor Gavin Newsom, who previously vetoed Wiener‚Äôs SB 1047 and has not commented on SB 53. The bill faces pushback from industry groups (CTA, Chamber of Progress), investors (a16z, Y Combinator), and the Trump administration, with critics arguing state action could chill innovation and violate the Constitution‚Äôs Commerce Clause by burdening interstate commerce. OpenAI‚Äôs Chris Lehane urged Newsom to avoid regulations that drive startups out of the state, drawing rebuttals from former OpenAI policy lead Miles Brundage; notably, SB 53 targets only very large firms with over $500 million in gross revenue. Compared to SB 1047, experts describe SB 53 as more modest and technically grounded, and lawmakers recently removed a third-party audit requirement; the goal is to codify existing lab safety practices into enforceable state law with financial penalties for noncompliance.

#### [Warner Bros. Joins Studios‚Äô AI Copyright Battle Against Midjourney](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/warner-bros-midjourney-lawsuit-ai-copyright-1236508618/)
![](https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-04-at-1.13.03-PM.png?w=647&h=317&crop=1)

Warner Bros. sued Midjourney, becoming the third major studio after Disney and Universal to accuse the AI image/video generator of copyright infringement. The complaint alleges Midjourney willfully produces still images and video of protected characters like Superman, Batman, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tom and Jerry, Joker, Flash, and Scooby-Doo. WB claims Midjourney recently removed guardrails that previously blocked infringing video creation, and that prompts can ‚Äúeasily‚Äù generate near-duplicate character depictions. The suit seeks statutory damages and an injunction to stop alleged infringement, arguing Midjourney could deploy protections to prevent duplication but has chosen not to.

Midjourney‚Äôs prior defense in the Disney-Universal case asserted ‚Äúfair use‚Äù for training on copyrighted works and noted its terms of service prohibit users from violating IP rights. The WB filing, brought by the same legal team as the Disney/Universal suits, follows a similar template and highlights Midjourney‚Äôs expansion into video and a 24/7 streaming channel (website and YouTube), with a stated plan for ‚Äúchannels‚Äù that WB says signals intent to enter TV/streaming markets. Midjourney‚Äôs lawyers have accused studios of hypocrisy for attacking ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù AI practices while seeking to profit from AI. The Motion Picture Association publicly backed the studios, warning that unchecked infringement threatens the U.S. motion picture industry and supporting strong IP enforcement alongside AI development.

#### [AI adoption linked to 13% decline in jobs for young U.S. workers, Stanford study reveals](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/28/generative-ai-reshapes-us-job-market-stanford-study-shows-entry-level-young-workers.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108177570-1753687681221-gettyimages-2170889984-2024_vrtg_sep_01_011.jpeg?v=1756368101&w=1920&h=1080)

A new Stanford study using ADP payroll data from millions of U.S. workers finds large, early labor-market effects from generative AI concentrated among entry-level employees. For workers aged 22‚Äì25 in AI-exposed occupations‚Äîcustomer service, accounting, and software development‚Äîemployment fell 13% since 2022, while employment for older workers in the same roles held steady or grew. In less-exposed occupations, such as nursing aides, employment rose across ages, with young health aides growing faster than older counterparts; front-line production/operations supervisors also saw gains for young workers, though smaller than for 35+. The authors attempted to isolate AI‚Äôs role by controlling for education, remote work, offshoring/outsourcing, and macroeconomic shifts, and note the paper is not yet peer-reviewed.

The study argues young workers are particularly vulnerable where AI substitutes for ‚Äúcodified knowledge‚Äù learned in school, while experience-based tacit knowledge is harder to replace. Impacts are non-uniform: in occupations where AI complements tasks and boosts efficiency rather than substitutes for them, employment changes were muted. The findings help explain stagnant national employment growth among young workers despite resilient overall employment post-pandemic, aligning with recent private-sector analyses pointing to early AI effects in tech and among younger employees. Researchers emphasize that many firms have not yet deployed AI at scale, suggesting these labor market impacts could intensify as adoption expands.
