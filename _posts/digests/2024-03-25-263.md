#### [Cerebras Unveils Its Next Waferscale AI Chip](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cerebras-chip-cs3)
![](https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-person-in-a-white-bunny-suit-holds-a-golden-diamond-shaped-plate-with-a-pattern-of-holes-in-it.png?id=51721250&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C56%2C0%2C56)

The article discusses the unveiling of Cerebras' latest waferscale AI chip. Samuel K. Moore, the senior editor at IEEE Spectrum, who is responsible for semiconductors coverage, provides an in-depth analysis of the new chip. Moore, an IEEE member with a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering from Brown University and a master's degree in journalism from New York University, offers expert commentary on the technical aspects and potential impact of Cerebras' new AI chip. The article does not provide specific details about the chip's capabilities or applications, but it suggests that this development could be significant in the field of artificial intelligence.

#### [MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611v1)


The article discusses the development and performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), focusing on the significance of different architecture components and data choices. The authors found that a balanced mix of image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is essential for achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in large-scale multimodal pre-training. They also discovered that the image encoder, image resolution, and image token count have a significant impact, while the design of the vision-language connector is less important. The authors then present MM1, a family of multimodal models with up to 30 billion parameters, including both dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants. These models demonstrate superior pre-training metrics and competitive performance after supervised fine-tuning on various multimodal benchmarks.

#### [Stability AI CEO resigns to â€˜pursue decentralized AIâ€™](https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/23/24109511/stability-ai-ceo-emad-mostaque-resignation-decentralized-ai)

Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI, has resigned from his position to focus on decentralized AI, a move that follows the recent departure of other key developers from the company. In the interim, COO Shan Shan Wong and CTO Christian Laforte will act as co-CEOs while the board searches for a permanent replacement. This leadership change comes amidst a turbulent time in the AI startup world, with rival startup Inflection AI losing key personnel to Microsoft. Despite these challenges, Stability AI continues to develop and commercialize its AI products, including its flagship product, Stable Diffusion, and its latest model, Stable Cascade, while also offering a paid membership for commercial use of its models.
