Google's Project Astra, a real-time, multimodal AI assistant, is the future of AI at Google, according to Demis Hassabis, the head of Google DeepMind. Revealed at Google I/O, Astra can identify objects, answer questions, and assist with tasks in a conversational manner. The project is part of Google's Gemini announcements, which include new models like Gemini 1.5 Flash for faster task completion, Veo for video generation from text prompts, and Gemini Nano for local device use. Hassabis envisions AI's future to be less about the models and more about their functionality, with AI agents performing tasks on behalf of users. He believes that Astra is closer to a true real-time AI assistant and that improving speed and latency has been a key focus for the team.

OpenAI has announced the release of GPT-4o, an enhanced version of the GPT-4 model that powers ChatGPT. The new model is touted as being significantly faster and having improved capabilities across text, vision, and audio. It will be available for free to all users, with paid users receiving up to five times the capacity limits. The model is "natively multimodal," meaning it can generate content or understand commands in voice, text, or images. Developers will have access to the API, which is cheaper and faster than its predecessor, GPT-4 Turbo. The new model will also bring improvements to ChatGPT's voice mode, enabling it to act as a real-time voice assistant. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, acknowledged a shift in the company's vision from creating benefits for the world to making advanced AI models available to developers for creation through paid APIs.

OpenAI, a leading tech company in artificial intelligence, recently announced the resignation of its co-founder and chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, and his co-team leader, Jan Leike. This news came amidst the release of ChatGPT 4o, a product that can converse like a human. However, the company's restrictive off-boarding agreement, which includes non-disclosure and non-disparagement provisions, has raised concerns. This agreement forbids former employees from criticizing OpenAI and can result in the loss of vested equity if violated. Despite the company's initial commitment to transparency and accountability, these recent developments have led to speculation about OpenAI's shift away from a safety-focused culture and its lack of transparency.
