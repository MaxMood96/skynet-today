#### [Elon Musk Revives Lawsuit Against OpenAI and Sam Altman](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/elon-musk-openai-lawsuit.html)

Elon Musk has reinitiated a lawsuit against OpenAI, the creator of the AI chatbot ChatGPT, reigniting a longstanding dispute that originated from a power conflict within the San Francisco-based startup. The lawsuit, filed in a Northern California federal court, alleges that OpenAI and its co-founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, violated the company's founding agreement by prioritizing commercial interests over public welfare. Musk had previously withdrawn his initial lawsuit without providing a reason, just a day before a judge was due to decide on its dismissal. The lawsuit contends that Altman and Brockman deviated from their original commitment to develop artificial intelligence responsibly for the benefit of humanity when they entered into a multi-billion dollar partnership with Microsoft.

OpenAI co-founder John Schulman has left the company to join rival AI startup Anthropic, while OpenAI president and co-founder Greg Brockman is taking an extended leave until the end of the year. Schulman, who played a key role in creating the AI-powered chatbot platform ChatGPT and led OpenAI's alignment science efforts, stated his move was driven by a desire to focus more on AI alignment and hands-on technical work. Peter Deng, a product manager who joined OpenAI last year, has also left the company. With these departures, only three of OpenAI's original 11 founders remain: CEO Sam Altman, Brockman, and Wojciech Zaremba, lead of language and code generation.

![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/pplx-publishers-program.png?resize=1200,675)

Perplexity AI, a startup that uses a chatbot to surface content in response to user queries, plans to share advertising revenue with news publishers whose content is used by the bot. This move comes in response to accusations of plagiarism and unethical web scraping. The company's first publishing partners include Automattic, Der Spiegel, Entrepreneur, Fortune, The Texas Tribune, and TIME. These publishers will gain access to Perplexity's APIs and developer support, enabling them to create custom answer engines on their sites. The revenue-sharing model will be implemented once Perplexity begins displaying ads on its platform in the coming months. The company has not disclosed the exact percentage of ad revenue to be shared but confirmed it would be in the "double digits".

Meta has launched a new tool called AI Studio, allowing users in the US to create AI versions of themselves on Instagram or the web. The tool is aimed at creators and business owners who can use these AI profiles to interact with their followers, respond to comments, and even auto-reply from their AI. The AI can be customized based on the user's Instagram content, topics to avoid, and links to share. AI Studio also enables the creation of entirely new AI characters that can be used across Meta's apps, competing with startups like Character.AI and Replika. Despite potential issues with AI versions of celebrities saying problematic things, Meta is pushing forward with this concept, which was initially tested with a few celebrities.
