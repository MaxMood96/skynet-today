#### [Meta releases Llama 4, a new crop of flagship AI models](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/05/meta-releases-llama-4-a-new-crop-of-flagship-ai-models/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2173579488.jpg?resize=1200,799)

Meta has launched a new suite of AI models, Llama 4, which includes Llama 4 Scout, Llama 4 Maverick, and Llama 4 Behemoth. These models were trained on large volumes of unlabeled text, image, and video data to enhance their visual understanding capabilities. The Llama 4 models are the first to use a mixture of experts (MoE) architecture, which improves computational efficiency by dividing data processing tasks among smaller, specialized models. However, the use of these models is restricted in the EU due to regional AI and data privacy laws, and companies with over 700 million monthly active users must obtain a special license from Meta. The Llama 4 models are designed to respond to contentious questions more frequently and in a more balanced manner than previous models.


#### [OpenAI's Revenue Set to Triple After Jump in Paid ChatGPT Users](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openais-revenue-set-triple-jump-173205114.html)

OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research lab, has seen a 30% increase in its paid subscriber base for ChatGPT, rising from 15.5 million to over 20 million in the last quarter. This surge has led to a corresponding 30% increase in monthly revenue, from $333 million to $415 million. The company, recently valued at $300 billion following a $40 billion funding round led by SoftBank and supported by Microsoft, also revealed that ChatGPT is used by over 500 million people weekly. OpenAI projects a significant revenue expansion, expecting to triple its total to $12.7 billion in 2025 from $3.7 billion in 2024, and anticipates generating $29.4 billion in 2026.


#### [Amazon unveils Nova Act, an AI agent that can control a web browser](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/amazon-unveils-nova-act-an-ai-agent-that-uses-a-web-browser/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-1445867611.jpg?w=1024)

Amazon has introduced Nova Act, a general-purpose AI agent capable of controlling a web browser and performing simple tasks independently. Developed by Amazon's AGI lab, Nova Act will be a key component of the upcoming Alexa+ upgrade, an AI-enhanced version of Amazon's voice assistant. The Nova Act SDK, also released by Amazon, allows developers to build agent prototypes, enabling AI agents to navigate web pages, fill out forms, and schedule dates on a calendar. Despite the crowded market, Amazon claims that Nova Act outperforms similar agents from OpenAI and Anthropic in several internal tests. However, the reliability of these AI agents across different domains remains a significant challenge, with early versions often slow, struggling to operate independently, and prone to errors.


#### [Adobe launches Premiere Proâ€™s generative AI video extender](https://www.theverge.com/news/641270/adobe-premiere-pro-generative-extend-generally-available)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Generative-Extend-4.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.4613147178592%2C100%2C93.077370564282&w=1200)

Adobe has released version 25.2 of Premiere Pro, introducing AI-powered features designed to enhance video editing. The most significant addition is Generative Extend, a tool powered by Adobe's Firefly generative AI video model, which allows users to extend video clips by up to two seconds and ambient background audio by up to ten seconds. This feature is free for a limited time, after which users will need to spend Firefly generative credits. The update also includes an AI-powered Search panel that recognizes the content of clips, enabling users to search for footage using text descriptions. Additionally, Premiere Pro can now automatically translate video captions into 27 languages and offers improved speed and performance on both Apple silicon and Windows devices.
