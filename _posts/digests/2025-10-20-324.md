OpenAI‚Äôs DevDay 2025 turned ChatGPT into more of an OS with ‚Äúapps inside ChatGPT‚Äù and a new Apps SDK built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Users can now ‚Äútalk to apps‚Äù like Canva, Zillow, Coursera, Figma, Spotify, Booking.com, and Expedia directly in-chat; ChatGPT can also surface relevant apps automatically (e.g., Spotify for a party playlist) and render interactive UIs, including videos pinned in the chat. The Apps SDK (preview) lets developers build full-screen, embeddable app experiences, with planned monetization via Instant Checkout and account login passthrough for existing subscribers. A live demo showed creating a poster in Canva, auto-generating a pitch deck, then querying Zillow with natural language to filter listings and view an interactive map inside ChatGPT.

OpenAI also launched AgentKit to streamline agent development and deployment: Agent Builder (a visual ‚ÄúCanva for agents‚Äù), ChatKit (an embeddable chat UI), Evals for Agents (step-by-step trace grading, datasets, automated prompt optimization, and external-model evals), and a connectors registry with admin controls for secure integrations. In a live demo, an entire multi-agent workflow‚ÄîSession agent, DevDay agent, guardrails, and a PII agent‚Äîwas built and shipped in under eight minutes, with real-time step tracing and deployment via workflow ID. Codex exited research preview and is now GA; onstage it wired an Xbox 360 controller to drive a camera, built a voice assistant to control lighting, added a credits overlay, countdown, and crowd photo capture. API updates include GPT-5 Pro for high-accuracy, depth-of-reasoning use cases; Sora 2 in API preview for physically consistent video with synchronized sound and detailed camera control; and gpt-realtime-mini, a low-latency voice model that‚Äôs 70% cheaper than the prior advanced voice model. Altman said ChatGPT now has 800M weekly active users, 4M developers, and the API processes 6B tokens per minute.

#### [OpenAI Inks Deal With Broadcom to Design Its Own Chips for A.I.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/13/technology/openai-broadcom-chips-deal.html)

 * [Broadcom stock pops 9% on OpenAI custom chip deal, adding to Nvidia and AMD agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/13/openai-partners-with-broadcom-custom-ai-chips-alongside-nvidia-amd.html)

![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13openai-broadcom-wqpc/13openai-broadcom-wqpc-facebookJumbo.jpg)

OpenAI officially partnered with Broadcom to co-design and deploy custom AI accelerators, targeting 10 gigawatts of compute starting late next year, with systems spanning compute, memory, and networking built on Broadcom‚Äôs Ethernet stack. The deal focuses on OpenAI-designed chips (Broadcom calls its custom parts XPUs), aiming to cut compute costs and reduce dependence on Nvidia and AMD while increasing bargaining leverage. Unlike its arrangements with Nvidia and AMD‚Äîwhich include a planned $100 billion investment by Nvidia and roughly 160 million AMD shares (about 10% of AMD)‚ÄîBroadcom is not investing equity; it is providing design and manufacturing collaboration. OpenAI says it used its own models to optimize chip layouts, achieving ‚Äúmassive area reductions,‚Äù and expects efficiency gains to yield faster and cheaper models. Broadcom‚Äôs stock jumped ~9.9% on the news, though the company clarified OpenAI is not the previously discussed $10 billion mystery customer.

This move slots into OpenAI‚Äôs broader AI buildout, which includes new data centers in Abilene, Texas and additional sites in Texas, New Mexico, Ohio, and the Midwest, part of an industry-wide capex wave exceeding $325 billion this year by OpenAI, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. OpenAI currently runs just over 2 GW of capacity but has recently announced roughly 33 GW of compute commitments across Nvidia, Oracle, AMD, and Broadcom, with CEO Sam Altman signaling 10 GW is ‚Äújust the beginning.‚Äù Industry estimates put a 1 GW AI data center at about $50 billion, with ~$35 billion for chips at current Nvidia pricing‚Äîunderscoring the economic rationale for custom silicon. Broadcom, already supplying hyperscalers like Google, Meta, and ByteDance per analysts, framed OpenAI as pushing the most advanced frontier models, requiring continual access to the ‚Äúbest, latest compute capacity‚Äù and greater control via in-house chips.

#### [Anthropic launches new version of scaled-down ‚ÄòHaiku‚Äô model](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/anthropic-launches-new-version-of-scaled-down-haiku-model/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-15-at-10.38.58-AM.jpg?w=800)

Anthropic released Claude Haiku 4.5, its smallest model, claiming Sonnet 4-level performance at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed. The company reports Haiku 4.5 scores 73% on SWE-Bench verified and 41% on Terminal-Bench, placing it below Sonnet 4.5 but on par with Sonnet 4, GPT-5, and Gemini 2.5 on those tasks. Anthropic says tests show similar parity on benchmarks for tool use, computer use, and visual reasoning. Haiku 4.5 is rolling out immediately to all free Anthropic plans, targeting low-latency, cost-sensitive workloads and enabling parallel deployments of multiple lightweight agents.

Anthropic positions Haiku 4.5 as a fast ‚Äúsub-agent‚Äù to pair with heavier models like Sonnet in production. CPO Mike Krieger described a toolbox approach: Sonnet for complex planning, with Haiku-powered sub-agents executing tasks at speed. The model is expected to impact software development tools first, where Claude Code is already used and latency is critical; Zencoder‚Äôs CEO called it enabling ‚Äúan entirely new set of use cases.‚Äù The launch follows Sonnet 4.5 (two weeks ago) and Opus 4.1 (two months ago), and updates the prior Haiku released in October 2024.

#### Research

[Evolution Strategies at Scale: LLM Fine-Tuning Beyond Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24372). The paper demonstrates that a memory‚Äëefficient, highly parallel Evolution Strategies method can directly search multi‚Äëbillion‚Äëparameter LLM spaces to fine‚Äëtune models using only response‚Äëlevel rewards, achieving better sample efficiency, robustness, and behavioral consistency than common RL approaches on reasoning tasks.

[Reasoning with Sampling: Your Base Model is Smarter Than You Think](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14901). Using a training‚Äëfree MCMC sampler targeting a power distribution over base‚Äëmodel token likelihoods, the authors reach single‚Äëshot reasoning performance comparable to or better than RL‚Äëposttrained models while preserving diversity and avoiding RL‚Äôs training and verifier requirements.

[Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364). The authors argue base models already possess core reasoning behaviors, while thinking models primarily learn when to activate them; targeted activation vectors at specific steps can recover most of the reasoning gap on benchmarks.

[How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11495). When rare but detailed chain‚Äëof‚Äëthought demonstrations exist in pretraining data, reinforcement learning with a correctness reward rapidly amplifies those long trajectories‚Äîlengthening generations and enabling generalization on hard tasks that next‚Äëtoken prediction alone fails to learn.

[The Art of Scaling Reinforcement Learning Compute for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13786). A predictive sigmoid‚Äëlike scaling framework and an empirically validated training recipe, ScaleRL, help researchers extrapolate from low‚Äëcompute runs, identify scalable methods early, and plan more efficient RL improvements at large budgets.

[Memory as Action: Autonomous Context Curation for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12635). The work lets agents learn to edit and manage working memory via explicit memory‚Äëediting actions and a new RL algorithm (DCPO), balancing task performance against token and latency costs for long‚Äëhorizon tasks.

[Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171). The paper ties human typicality bias in preference data to mode collapse and introduces Verbalized Sampling‚Äîa training‚Äëfree prompt asking models to produce a distribution of responses with probabilities‚Äîto restore much of pretrained LLMs‚Äô inherent diversity without harming accuracy or safety.

[Provable Scaling Laws of Feature Emergence from Learning Dynamics of Grokking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21519v3). A three‚Äëstage gradient‚Äëdynamics framework for two‚Äëlayer networks shows how early output‚Äëlayer memorization yields informative gradients that drive independent then interactive hidden‚Äëfeature learning; an energy function proves scaling laws that determine when features generalize versus memorize.

[Cautious Weight Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402). This optimizer applies weight decay only to parameter dimensions where the update points in the same direction as the parameter, improving stability and often accelerating convergence without extra hyperparameters.

[Can GenAI Improve Academic Performance? Evidence from the Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02408).
