#### [White House Releases AI Action Plan to Cement U.S. Leadership](https://natlawreview.com/article/white-house-reveals-ai-action-plan)
![](https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-07/President%20Donald%20Trump%20White%20House%20Website-211799041.jpg.webp?itok=a56S0EFq)

On July 23, 2025, the White House unveiled "Winning the AI Race: America‚Äôs AI Action Plan", a comprehensive strategy to cement U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence (AI). The plan, which follows President Trump's executive order on Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI, outlines over 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: Accelerating Innovation, Building American AI Infrastructure, and Leading in International Diplomacy and Security. The plan aims to usher in a new era of human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security for the American people.

Key policies in the AI Action Plan include exporting American AI through partnerships between the Commerce and State Departments and industry, promoting rapid buildout of data centers, enabling innovation and adoption by removing federal regulations that hinder AI development, and upholding free speech in frontier models. The plan emphasizes the importance of AI as a cornerstone of American innovation and global influence, and seeks to ensure that American workers and families thrive in the AI era. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios, AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, and Secretary of State and Acting National Security Advisor Marco Rubio all stressed the urgency of winning the AI race for the U.S.'s economic and national security.

#### [OpenAI prepares to launch GPT-5 in August](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257594_NOTEPAD_OPENAI_CVirginia.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

OpenAI is preparing to launch its next-generation model, GPT-5, as early as August, according to sources familiar with the company's plans. The model, which has been spotted in the wild, will be available in mini and nano versions through OpenAI's API. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has described GPT-5 as a system that integrates a lot of their technology, including the o3 reasoning capabilities. The integration of these capabilities is part of OpenAI's ongoing efforts to simplify and combine its large language models to create a more capable system that can eventually be declared artificial general intelligence (AGI).

The declaration of AGI is significant for OpenAI as it would force Microsoft to relinquish its rights to OpenAI revenue and its future AI models. However, it is unlikely that GPT-5 will meet the AGI threshold linked to OpenAI's profits. The unification of its o-series and GPT-series models will also reduce the friction of having to know which model to pick for each task in ChatGPT. The main combined reasoning version of GPT-5 will be available through ChatGPT and OpenAI‚Äôs API, and the mini version will also be available on ChatGPT and the API. The nano version of GPT-5 is expected to only be available through the API.

#### [Big Tech split? Google to sign EU‚Äôs AI guidelines despite Meta snub](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/big-tech-split-google-to-sign-eus-ai-guidelines-despite-meta-snub.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108125067-1743612093512-gettyimages-2189492700-vcg111536239152.jpeg?v=1743612242&w=1920&h=1080)

Google has announced its intention to sign the European Union's guidelines on artificial intelligence (AI), a move that contrasts with Meta's decision to reject the same guidelines due to concerns about stifling innovation. Google believes that adhering to these guidelines will facilitate European citizens' access to new AI tools as they become available. The company's endorsement comes after Meta's refusal to sign the code, citing concerns that it could limit European AI innovation.

The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, has published a final version of its code of practice for general-purpose AI models, leaving the decision to sign up to individual companies. Google's President of Global Affairs, Kent Walker, emphasized the importance of prompt and widespread deployment of AI, suggesting that embracing AI could boost Europe's economy by 1.4 trillion euros ($1.62 trillion) annually by 2034.

#### [OpenAI launches Study Mode in ChatGPT](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/openai-launches-study-mode-in-chatgpt/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OpenAI-and-ChatGPT.jpeg?resize=1200,676)

OpenAI has launched a new feature called Study Mode in its AI chatbot, ChatGPT, aimed at fostering critical thinking skills in students. Instead of providing direct answers, the feature prompts users with questions to test their understanding of the material. The feature is being rolled out to users on Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans, with plans to introduce it to Edu subscribers in the coming weeks. The move is a response to concerns that while ChatGPT can be a useful tutoring tool, it may also negatively impact students' critical thinking abilities.

Despite the potential benefits of Study Mode, there are limitations to its effectiveness. Students can easily switch back to the regular mode if they want direct answers, and currently, there are no tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. OpenAI's VP of Education, Leah Belsky, has indicated that the company may consider implementing such controls in the future. The launch of Study Mode is part of OpenAI's broader efforts to improve learning through ChatGPT, with plans to publish more information on how students use generative AI in their education.
