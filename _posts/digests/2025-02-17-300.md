#### [OpenAI lays out plans for GPT-5](https://www.theverge.com/news/611365/openai-gpt-4-5-roadmap-sam-altman-orion)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/STK155_OPEN_AI_2025_CVirgiia_D.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, has outlined the company's plans for its upcoming AI models, GPT-4.5 and GPT-5, in a recent roadmap. The GPT-4.5, internally known as Orion, is set to be the company's last non-chain-of-thought model, with the aim to simplify OpenAI's product lineup. The GPT-5 model is planned to integrate a lot of the company's technology, including o3, and will no longer be shipped as a standalone model. While the exact release dates for these models are not specified, Altman has hinted at a timeline of weeks to months. Furthermore, upon the release of GPT-5, free ChatGPT users will have unlimited chat access at the standard intelligence setting, with Plus and Pro subscribers having access to higher levels of intelligence.


#### [Google-backed public interest AI partnership launches with $400M+ pledged for open ecosystem building](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/google-backed-public-interest-ai-partnership-launches-with-400m-pledged-for-open-ecosystem-building/)

Current AI, a public interest initiative backed by Google and other partners, has launched with over $400 million in pledges to foster the development of artificial intelligence (AI) for societal benefits. The initiative aims to raise $2.5 billion over the next five years to advance public interest in areas such as healthcare and climate goals. The initiative's objectives include widening access to high-quality public and private datasets for AI training, supporting open-source infrastructure to enhance AI transparency and security, and developing systems to measure AI's social and environmental impact. The initiative is backed by governments in France, Germany, Chile, Kenya, Morocco, and Nigeria, among others, as well as tech giants Google and Salesforce.


#### [Thomson Reuters Wins First Major AI Copyright Case in the US](https://www.wired.com/story/thomson-reuters-ai-copyright-lawsuit/)
![](https://media.wired.com/photos/67abae4e99ebae2e3bcfd8a3/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Reuters-AI-Lawsuit-Win-Business-1993633254.jpg)

Thomson Reuters has emerged victorious in the first major AI copyright case in the United States, setting a precedent for future legal battles in the rapidly evolving field of AI. The media and technology conglomerate had accused legal AI startup Ross Intelligence of reproducing materials from its legal research firm, Westlaw, without permission. The court ruled in favor of Thomson Reuters, rejecting Ross Intelligence's defenses and affirming that the company's copyright was infringed. This ruling is significant as it challenges the 'fair use' doctrine often invoked by AI companies, suggesting that the use of copyrighted materials to train AI systems may not be legally permissible. The decision could have far-reaching implications for AI companies, potentially complicating their fair use arguments in future copyright disputes.


#### [Elon Musk Leads $97.4 Billion Bid to Control OpenAI](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/technology/elon-musk-openai-bid.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/10/multimedia/10openai-musk-hfo-tblm/10openai-musk-hfo-tblm-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Elon Musk, in collaboration with a consortium of investors including Vy Capital, Xai, and Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel, has proposed a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the assets of OpenAI, a nonprofit organization he co-founded nearly a decade ago. This move marks Musk's latest and potentially most daring attempt to gain control over the future of artificial intelligence, a field in which he has been in a longstanding dispute with OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman. Despite the substantial offer, the bid faces significant challenges as OpenAI's board of directors is closely aligned with Altman, who has already dismissed Musk's proposal. The ongoing negotiations and their implications for the AI industry were initially reported by The Wall Street Journal.
