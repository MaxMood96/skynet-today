The "productivity paradox," a term from the personal computer boom, is resurfacing with generative AI. McKinsey & Company research shows that while nearly 80% of companies use generative AI, the same percentage sees no significant impact on their bottom line. Despite rapid AI advancements, such as chatbots like ChatGPT, the expected business revolution remains elusive.

Several issues contribute to this lag, including chatbots' tendency to generate inaccurate information. The fierce competition among tech giants and start-ups has accelerated AI development, but the anticipated business sector revolution is still pending. The research highlights the importance of businesses evaluating AI's potential benefits and drawbacks before investing heavily.

#### [Anthropic takes aim at OpenAI, offers Claude to ‚Äòall three branches of government‚Äô for $1](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/anthropic-takes-aim-at-openai-offers-claude-to-all-three-branches-of-government-for-1/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159671948.jpg?resize=1200,800)

Anthropic has announced a bold move to offer its Claude models to all three branches of the U.S. government for just $1 per year. This initiative follows OpenAI's similar offer of ChatGPT Enterprise to the federal executive branch. Anthropic's package includes Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government, supporting FedRAMP High workloads for sensitive unclassified work. Recently, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind were added to the General Services Administration‚Äôs list of approved AI vendors for civilian federal agencies.

This offer is part of Anthropic's strategy to expand its presence in federal AI usage. The company believes the U.S. public sector should access advanced AI capabilities to address complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services. Claude is already in use at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the District of Columbia Department of Health. Anthropic plans to provide technical support to help agencies integrate AI tools into their workflows. Alongside OpenAI, xAI, and Google, Anthropic has been granted up to $200 million by the Department of Defense to leverage AI for national security.

#### [Goodbye, $165,000 Tech Jobs. Student Coders Seek Work at Chipotle.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/technology/coding-ai-jobs-students.html)

The job market for computer science graduates is becoming increasingly challenging due to the rise of AI programming tools and layoffs at major tech companies. Despite the push for coding education in the early 2010s, backed by tech executives, billionaires, and even U.S. presidents, the promise of high salaries and job security is no longer guaranteed. The boom in computer science education, which saw the number of undergraduates majoring in the field more than double from 2014 to 2020, is now facing a reality check. AI programming tools can generate thousands of lines of code quickly, reducing the need for human coders, while layoffs at companies like Amazon, Intel, Meta, and Microsoft further shrink the job pool.

The shift in the job market is causing a significant disruption for recent computer science graduates. Despite the previous promises of starting salaries over $100,000, hiring bonuses, and stock grants, many graduates are struggling to find employment in their field. The spread of AI programming tools and the economic impact of layoffs at major tech companies have significantly dimmed the prospects in a field that was once promoted as a golden career ticket. This turnabout is derailing the employment dreams of many new computing grads, forcing them to look for work in other areas.
