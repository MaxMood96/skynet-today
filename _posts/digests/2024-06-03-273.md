Vox Media has announced a strategic partnership with OpenAI, aiming to leverage AI technology to enhance its content and product offerings. The collaboration will see Vox Media's portfolio, including Vox, The Verge, Eater, and New York Magazine, contribute to the information provided to ChatGPT's 100 million users. OpenAI's technology will be used to develop new products for Vox Media's consumers and advertising partners, and to enhance Vox Media's affiliate commerce product, The Strategist Gift Scout. The partnership will also extend the capabilities of Forte, Vox Media's first-party data platform, improving creative optimization and audience segment targeting for advertisers.

#### [Google Rolls Back A.I. Search Feature After Flubs and Flaws](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/technology/google-ai-overviews-rollback.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/01/multimedia/01google-rollback-jqlm/01google-rollback-jqlm-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Google's new artificial intelligence feature for its search engine, A.I. Overviews, has been significantly rolled back after it produced a series of errors and false information. Introduced by CEO Sundar Pichai, the feature was designed to generate comprehensive information summaries above traditional search results. However, tests by The New York Times revealed that only one of the six queries initially demonstrated still yielded an A.I. Overview. The rollback appears to be a response to the feature's numerous mistakes, including recommending glue in a pizza recipe and suggesting the ingestion of rocks for nutrients, which led to widespread user complaints and mockery on social media.
