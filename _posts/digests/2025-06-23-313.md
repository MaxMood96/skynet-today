#### [AI Co. Anthropic Nabs Partial Fair Use Win in Copyright Case](https://www.thefashionlaw.com/ai-co-anthropic-nabs-partial-fair-use-win-in-copyright-case/)

A federal court in California has partially sided with AI company Anthropic in a copyright lawsuit over the training of a generative AI model. The court ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its large language models may qualify as fair use, but its acquisition and storage of pirated digital copies does not. The lawsuit was filed by authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson, who claimed that Anthropic built its generative AI product, Claude, by using hundreds of thousands of copyrighted books without permission. Anthropic argued that its use of copyright-protected books, whether downloaded from pirate sources or scanned from purchased print copies, was protected under the doctrine of fair use.

Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California divided his analysis into two core uses: the use of books to train language models and the creation of a permanent internal library of books, many of them pirated. He ruled that using copyrighted books to train AI models was "quintessentially transformative" and therefore fair use. He also found that Anthropic's digitization of legally purchased print books was a permissible fair use. However, Anthropic's decision to build its library using pirated books downloaded from illegal sources was not deemed transformative and therefore not protected under the doctrine of fair use. The court's decision is among the earliest substantive decisions in a series of high-profile copyright cases against AI developers.

#### [OpenAI and Microsoft Tensions Are Reaching a Boiling Point](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-and-microsoft-tensions-are-reaching-a-boiling-point-4981c44f)
#### [Googleâ€™s Gemini AI family updated with stable 2.5 Pro, super-efficient 2.5 Flash-Lite](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/googles-gemini-ai-family-updated-with-stable-2-5-pro-super-efficient-2-5-flash-lite/)
![](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Gemini-2.5-Tulsee-1152x648.jpg)

Google has announced the expansion of its Gemini AI model family with the introduction of the Gemini 2.5 Pro and the Gemini 2.5 Pro Flash-Lite. The Gemini 2.5 Pro, which has been in preview for several months, is now stable and ready for developers to build on. The Gemini 2.5 Pro Flash-Lite, on the other hand, is a high-efficiency model currently in preview. It offers a cost-effective solution for running high-volume AI workloads, costing one-third of the price for text, image, and video inputs and less than one-sixth of the cost for output tokens compared to the 2.5 Flash model.

The Gemini 2.5 models have shown significant improvements over previous versions, making Google more competitive with OpenAI and its GPT models. All Gemini 2.5 models include adjustable thinking budgets, which are attractive to developers seeking more control over costs. The 2.5 Flash model has already left preview and reached general availability with the 04-17 build, while the Gemini 2.5 Pro has also left preview and reached general availability with the recently revamped 06-05 build. The Gemini 2.5 Pro Flash-Lite, however, is less capable than the 2.5 Flash and is primarily targeted at developers paying by the token.

#### [MiniMax M1 model claims Chinese LLM crown from DeepSeek - plus it's true open-source](https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/17/minimax_m1_model_chinese_llm/)
![](https://regmedia.co.uk/2022/06/10/shutterstock_china_dragon.jpg)

Shanghai-based AI firm MiniMax has launched an open-source reasoning model, MiniMax-M1, that competes with Chinese rival DeepSeek and US-based Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google in terms of performance and cost. The model, released under an Apache software license, is fully open-source, unlike Meta's Llama family and DeepSeek, which are only partially open-source. MiniMax claims that M1's capabilities are top-tier among open-source models, surpassing domestic closed-source models and approaching the leading overseas models, all while offering the industry's best cost-effectiveness. The model is competitive with OpenAI o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 4 Opus, DeepSeek R1, DeepSeek R1-0528, and Qwen3-235B on various benchmarks.

MiniMax-M1's context window, the amount of input it can handle, is one million tokens, which rivals Google Gemini 2.5 Pro and is eight times the capacity of DeepSeek R1. In terms of output, the model can manage 80,000 tokens, better than DeepSeek's 64,000 token capacity but shy of OpenAI's o3, which can spit out 100,000 tokens in response to a prompt. MiniMax's Lightning Attention mechanism, a method to calculate attention matrices that improves both training and inference efficiency, gives its M1 model an advantage when computing long context inputs and when trying to reason. This more efficient computation method, in conjunction with an improved reinforcement learning algorithm called CISPO, translates to lower computing costs.

#### [Tesla Begins Limited Robotaxi Service in Austin](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/22/business/tesla-robotaxi-service-austin.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/22/multimedia/22biz-tesla-robotaxi-hjpl/22biz-tesla-robotaxi-hjpl-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Tesla has initiated limited operations of its self-driving taxi service, Robotaxi, in Austin, Texas. The service, which is currently available only to select guests, is confined to certain streets and is accompanied by safety monitors in the front passenger seats. The vehicles are not operational in adverse weather conditions. This move is the first step in a rollout that CEO Elon Musk believes will make autonomous ride-hailing widespread and generate significant revenue.

The Robotaxi service allows early access riders to use the new Robotaxi app and experience an autonomous ride within a geofenced area in Austin. Tesla's $1 trillion stock market valuation largely hinges on Musk's promises that the company will leverage artificial intelligence to enable its electric cars to drive autonomously on virtually any road. The limited rollout in Austin is attracting considerable attention from investors, analysts, and Tesla supporters, and will provide initial insights into whether Tesla's technology can live up to Musk's ambitions.
