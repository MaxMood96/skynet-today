#### [Image Playground, ChatGPT, and more Apple Intelligence features roll out in beta](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/image-playground-chatgpt-and-more-apple-intelligence-features-roll-out-in-beta/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/wwdc24-apple-intelligence-genmoji-02-e1718126844579.jpg?resize=1200,675)

Apple has released the latest developer beta versions of its operating systems, including iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2, introducing new Apple Intelligence features. These features include integrated writing tools, image cleanup, article summaries, and a typing input for Siri. The beta release also includes additional features such as Genmoji, Image Playground, Visual Intelligence, Image Wand, and ChatGPT integration. The ChatGPT integration, a third-party generative AI platform, will be used to answer questions through Siri and as a compositional tool within Writing Tools. Other features include Image Playground, which generates new images based on prompts, and Image Wand, which transforms sketches into finished artwork. The Visual Intelligence feature, similar to Google Lens, can scan QR codes, summarize text, detect contact details, translate languages, and provide contextual information about images.

GitHub is expanding its Copilot code completion and programming tool to include models from Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI, allowing developers to choose the model that best suits their needs. The company is also introducing Spark, an AI tool that simplifies the process of building web apps using natural language, and updates to GitHub Copilot in VS Code, Copilot for Xcode, among others. Spark uses OpenAI and Anthropic models to generate live previews of web apps, and allows both experienced and novice developers to manipulate code or create apps using natural language. GitHub's CEO, Thomas Dohmke, emphasizes the importance of multi-model functionality and choice in the next phase of AI code generation, and sees Spark as a tool to lower the barrier of entry to software development.

The article announces the introduction of an upgraded AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and a new model, Claude 3.5 Haiku, both of which show significant improvements in coding tasks. The Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the first to offer a new capability in public beta: computer use, which allows the AI to interact with computers in a human-like manner, such as looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text. Several companies, including Asana, Canva, Cognition, DoorDash, Replit, and The Browser Company, have begun exploring these capabilities. The article also introduces Claude 3.5 Haiku, which matches the performance of the previous largest model, Claude 3 Opus, and is particularly strong in coding tasks. Both models will be available on the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud‚Äôs Vertex AI.
