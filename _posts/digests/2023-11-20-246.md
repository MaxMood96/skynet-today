Sam Altman has been fired as CEO of OpenAI due to a lack of consistent communication with the board, hindering their ability to fulfill their responsibilities. Mira Murati, the chief technology officer, will serve as the interim CEO while the company searches for a permanent successor. Altman, who co-founded OpenAI, expressed his love for the company and described the experience of his firing as reading his own eulogy while still alive. Greg Brockman, co-founder and president, will step down as chairman of the board but remain at the company. Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI, has stated that it will continue to partner with the company.

#### [Lawsuit claims UnitedHealth AI wrongfully denies elderly extended care](https://www.reuters.com/legal/lawsuit-claims-unitedhealth-ai-wrongfully-denies-elderly-extended-care-2023-11-14/)

A proposed class action lawsuit has been filed against UnitedHealth Group Inc, alleging that the company's artificial intelligence algorithm wrongfully denies elderly patients' claims for extended care. The lawsuit claims that UnitedHealth uses the algorithm, known as nH Predict, to evaluate claims for post-acute care, such as stays in skilled nursing facilities and in-home care, and prematurely discontinues payment for healthcare services. Family members of two deceased UnitedHealth beneficiaries are seeking to represent a nationwide class of people on Medicare Advantage insurance plans, and claims for damages could reach billions of dollars. The lawsuit alleges that UnitedHealth's use of the algorithm violates contracts with patients and insurance laws, and seeks a court order to stop the practice and award money damages.

#### [On the Road with GPT-4V(ision): Early Explorations of Visual-Language Model on Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05332)
![](https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2311.05332/gradient.png)

The article discusses the early explorations of GPT-4V, a visual-language model, in the context of autonomous driving. GPT-4V is an extension of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model that incorporates visual information to understand and generate text. The researchers trained GPT-4V on a large dataset of driving scenes and evaluated its performance on various tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and visual grounding. The results show that GPT-4V performs well on these tasks, demonstrating its potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by enabling better understanding and communication between humans and vehicles.
