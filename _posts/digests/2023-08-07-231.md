#### [Mind Over Paralysis: AI Helps Quadriplegic Man Move and Feel Again](https://decrypt.co/151068/ai-brain-implant-paralyzed-quadriplegic-move-feel-touch)

In a groundbreaking medical advancement, AI-driven brain implants have enabled a quadriplegic man, Keith Thomas, to regain movement and sensation. After a devastating diving accident in 2020 that damaged his C4 and C5 vertebrae, scientists from Northwell Health’s Feinstein Institutes successfully performed a "double neural bypass" on Thomas. Surgeons implanted microchips in his brain that interface with AI algorithms to re-establish the connection between his brain, body, and spinal cord. When Thomas thinks about moving, the chip signals electrodes on his spine and arm muscles, facilitating movement. Additionally, sensors on his fingers send touch data back to his brain. Remarkably, Thomas' arm strength has more than doubled in just four months post-implantation. This innovative procedure builds upon prior single neural bypasses, with the potential to offer increased mobility and independence to many.

#### [Massachusetts regulators launch probe into AI in securities industry](https://www.reuters.com/technology/massachusetts-regulators-launch-probe-into-ai-securities-industry-2023-08-03/)
![](https://www.reuters.com/resizer/22pL9rK3FP8ux3Z-FfMgPSP6z-s=/1200x628/smart/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/BKLABEDUGBM7PKAZPFB2ARBXKQ.jpg)

Massachusetts securities regulators, led by Secretary of State Bill Galvin, have initiated an investigation into the use of AI by investment firms in their dealings with investors. The probe, which includes firms such as JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Tradier Brokerage, US Tiger Securities, E*Trade, Savvy Advisors, and Hearsay Systems, is driven by concerns about the potential misuse of AI technology without proper disclosure and consideration of conflicts. This move follows a proposal by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to mandate broker-dealers to eliminate possible conflicts of interest arising from the use of AI on trading platforms. The investigation will focus on the supervisory procedures firms have regarding AI and the disclosure process for those that have already deployed AI.

#### [Movie extras worry they'll be replaced by AI. Hollywood is already doing body scans](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/02/1190605685/movie-extras-worry-theyll-be-replaced-by-ai-hollywood-is-already-doing-body-scan)
![](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/08/02/background-actors_wide-92d5644aacb1c9441e5c412463c9d385dab6fde6-s1400-c100.jpg)

Background actors in Hollywood are expressing concerns about being replaced by AI as the industry increasingly uses body scans to create digital replicas. The Screen Actors Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) union is currently in a labor dispute with studios over the issue, with actors worried about the potential misuse of their digital likenesses and the lack of compensation for their use. The practice of body scanning is becoming more common, with actors often feeling they have no choice but to comply due to fear of retaliation. The advent of generative AI, which can create new conversations, images, and videos, has further fueled these concerns. The union and studios disagree over the meaning of consent, with studios proposing to ask for permission once, while the union insists on separate negotiations each time a digital likeness is used. 

#### [Meta is reportedly preparing to release AI-powered chatbots with different personas](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/01/meta-release-ai-powered-chatbots-with-different-personas/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/facebook-meta-rotate-pattern.jpg?resize=1200,675)

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is reportedly developing AI-powered chatbots with distinct personas, set to launch as early as next month. These chatbots, designed for human-like interactions, will adopt various personas, such as a surfer advising on travel plans or a chatbot speaking like Abraham Lincoln. The initiative aims to enhance user engagement on Meta's platforms, with the chatbots serving as a search tool and recommendation system. However, the move is likely to raise privacy concerns due to the potential for increased data collection for targeted content and ads. This development follows Snapchat's launch of its AI chatbot, "My AI", earlier this year. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has indicated that AI will play a significant role in the company's future products, improving interactions across mobile apps and the metaverse. The company's AI roadmap will be further detailed at the Connect developer event in September.
