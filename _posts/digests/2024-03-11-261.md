#### [Nvidia bans using translation layers for CUDA software to run on other chips ‚Äî new restriction apparently targets ZLUDA and some Chinese GPU makers](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-bans-using-translation-layers-for-cuda-software-to-run-on-other-chips-new-restriction-apparently-targets-zluda-and-some-chinese-gpu-makers)

Nvidia has updated its licensing terms to prohibit the use of translation layers for running CUDA-based software on non-Nvidia hardware platforms. This change, which was not included in the documentation of previous versions but is present in CUDA 11.6 and newer, appears to target initiatives like ZLUDA and some Chinese GPU makers that have been using translation layers to run CUDA code. The move is seen as an attempt to protect Nvidia's dominance in the accelerated computing space, particularly with AI applications. However, recompiling existing CUDA programs for other platforms remains legal, and as more competitive hardware enters the market, Nvidia's dominance could potentially be challenged.

#### [Competition in AI video generation heats up as Deepmind alums unveil Haiper](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/competition-in-ai-video-generation-heats-up-as-deepmind-alums-unveil-haiper/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Haiper-Image.jpeg?resize=1200,675)

DeepMind alumni Yishu Miao and Ziyu Wang have launched Haiper, an AI-powered video generation tool, amid increasing competition in the field. The duo, who have backgrounds in machine learning and 3D reconstruction, shifted their focus to video generation six months ago, finding it a more intriguing problem. Haiper, which has raised $13.8 million in seed funding, allows users to generate short videos for free using text prompts, with additional features such as animating images and repainting videos. While the company is currently focused on its consumer-facing website, it plans to develop a core video-generation model for commercial use. Haiper faces competition from other AI video generation tools like OpenAI's Sora and Google and Nvidia-backed Runway.
