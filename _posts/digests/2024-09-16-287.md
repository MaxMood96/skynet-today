#### [OpenAI releases o1, its first model with ‚Äòreasoning‚Äô abilities](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242439/openai-o1-model-reasoning-strawberry-chatgpt)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2e0-IzeyJ7KzcdVPwSc9wHJt9zc=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25462005/STK155_OPEN_AI_CVirginia_B.jpg)

OpenAI has launched a new model, o1, the first in a series of "reasoning" models designed to answer complex questions more quickly than humans. The model, also known as the Strawberry model, is more adept at writing code and solving multi-step problems than previous models, but is slower and more expensive to use. The training behind o1 is fundamentally different from its predecessors, using a new optimization algorithm and a new training dataset. The model has been trained using reinforcement learning, teaching the system through rewards and penalties, and uses a "chain of thought" to process queries. Despite its advancements, the model still struggles with hallucinations and lacks the ability to browse the web or process files and images.

#### [Sam Altman told OpenAI staff the company‚Äôs non-profit corporate structure will change next year](https://fortune.com/2024/09/13/sam-altman-openai-non-profit-structure-change-next-year/)
![](https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160791822_51bcf7.jpg?resize=1200,600)

OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has announced that the company's non-profit corporate structure will undergo changes in the coming year. The current structure, which Altman admits is "unusual," involves a non-profit arm controlling a for-profit arm, which in turn controls a holding company that oversees another for-profit entity. This last entity is where outside investors, such as Microsoft, have invested billions of dollars. While Altman did not provide specific details about the new structure, he indicated that the company will transition away from being controlled by a non-profit, making OpenAI a more traditional for-profit company. This change, which has been rumored for months, is expected to provide a more certain potential return for investors and align OpenAI with the structure of most other large tech businesses.


#### [Adobe‚Äôs Firefly AI Hits 12 Billion Generations, Previews Video Creator](https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2024/adobes-firefly-ai-hits-12-billion-generations-previews-video-creator/)

The company's CEO, Shantanu Narayen, emphasized the customer-centric approach to AI, with Firefly models trained on data that ensures commercial safety. Adobe has released Firefly models for imaging, vector and design, and previewed a new Firefly Video model. The company's third-quarter revenue rose 11% to $5.41 billion, with digital experience subscription revenue growing 12% to $1.23 billion. Adobe's AI solutions, including Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Services, are designed to address personalized content creation at scale and tackle content supply chain challenges.

#### [Runway launches new video-to-video AI tool ‚Äî here's what it can do](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/ai-image-video/runway-launches-new-video-to-video-ai-tool-heres-what-it-can-do)
![](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vuxjfDQ8wycTvjdH5NvUS-1200-80.gif)

AI video platform RunwayML has introduced a new video-to-video tool in its latest model, Gen-3 Alpha. This new feature allows users to customize real-world videos using artificial intelligence, a significant upgrade from the previous Gen-2 model which lacked this capability. The video-to-video tool, available on the web interface for paid plan users, allows for precise control over movement, expressiveness, and intent within video generations. Users can upload their input video and steer the generation with a text prompt for any aesthetic direction. This advancement in generative AI video technology enables users to apply new aesthetics or specific effects to real footage, enhancing the platform's utility.
