#### [OpenAI reportedly nears breakthrough with ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù AI, reveals progress framework](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/openai-reportedly-nears-breakthrough-with-reasoning-ai-reveals-progress-framework/)

OpenAI has introduced a five-tier system to track its progress towards developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), a type of AI that can perform tasks like a human without specialized training. The levels range from current AI capabilities to systems that could potentially manage entire organizations. OpenAI's technology, such as GPT-4o that powers ChatGPT, is currently at Level 1, which includes AI that can engage in conversational interactions. However, the company is reportedly close to reaching Level 2, or "Reasoners," which would be capable of basic problem-solving on par with a human with a doctorate degree. Despite the introduction of this system, there is no consensus in the AI research community on how to measure progress towards AGI, and some view OpenAI's five-tier system as a tool to attract investors rather than a scientific measurement of progress.

#### [A Hacker Stole OpenAI Secrets, Raising Fears That China Could, Too](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/04/technology/openai-hack.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/27/multimedia/00openai-hack-pcvf/00openai-hack-pcvf-facebookJumbo.jpg)

In early 2022, a hacker infiltrated OpenAI's internal messaging systems, stealing information about the design of the company's AI technologies. The breach occurred in an online forum where employees discussed the latest technologies, but the hacker did not gain access to the systems where the AI is built and stored. The incident was disclosed to employees and the board of directors in April 2023, but was not made public as no customer or partner information was compromised. OpenAI executives did not perceive the incident as a national security threat, believing the hacker to be a private individual with no connections to a foreign government, and therefore did not report the incident to law enforcement.

#### [Microsoft and Apple ditch OpenAI board seats amid regulatory scrutiny](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/10/24195528/microsoft-apple-openai-board-observer-seat-drop-regulator-scrutiny)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IujUpgnOiQg4gtWhZOyng69_hUk=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25418233/STK095_MICROSOFT_CVirginia_A.jpg)

Microsoft has relinquished its observer seat on the board of OpenAI, a move that comes less than eight months after it secured the non-voting position. Apple, which was reportedly planning to join OpenAI's nonprofit board, has also decided against it. These changes occur amid growing antitrust concerns over Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI, with regulators in the UK and EU scrutinizing the deal, along with other Big Tech AI investments. Despite this, OpenAI plans to continue its successful partnership with Microsoft and Apple through regular stakeholder meetings, aimed at fostering stronger collaboration across safety and security. Microsoft's investment in OpenAI, which exceeds $10 billion, has made it the exclusive cloud partner for OpenAI, powering all its workloads across products, API services, and research.

#### [FlashAttention-3: Fast and Accurate Attention with Asynchrony and Low-precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08608v1)


The article discusses the development of FlashAttention-3, an improved method for speeding up attention on Hopper GPUs, a key component of the Transformer architecture used in large language models. The new method utilizes three main techniques: exploiting asynchrony of the Tensor Cores and TMA to overlap computation and data movement, interleaving block-wise matmul and softmax operations, and using block quantization and incoherent processing that leverages hardware support for FP8 low-precision. The results show that FlashAttention-3 achieves a speedup on H100 GPUs by 1.5-2.0 times with FP16 reaching up to 740 TFLOPs/s (75% utilization), and with FP8 reaching close to 1.2 PFLOPs/s. Furthermore, FP8 FlashAttention-3 has been validated to achieve 2.6 times lower numerical error than a baseline FP8 attention.
