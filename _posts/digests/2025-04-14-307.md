### Top News

#### [OpenAI‚Äôs new GPT-4.1 AI models focus on coding](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/14/openais-new-gpt-4-1-models-focus-on-coding/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2021258442.jpg?resize=1200,800)

OpenAI has launched a new family of AI models, GPT-4.1, which includes GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano. These models are designed to excel at coding and instruction following, with a 1-million-token context window, allowing them to process approximately 750,000 words at once. The models are part of OpenAI's ambition to create AI coding models capable of complex software engineering tasks, including programming entire apps end-to-end. The GPT-4.1 models have been optimized for real-world use, with improvements in areas such as frontend coding, format adherence, and consistent tool usage. However, OpenAI acknowledges that the models become less reliable as the number of input tokens increases, and they often require more specific, explicit prompts.


#### [OpenAI launches a pair of AI reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-launches-a-pair-of-ai-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini/)

OpenAI has launched two new AI reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini, which are designed to pause and work through questions before responding. The o3 model is touted as OpenAI's most advanced reasoning model, outperforming previous models in tests measuring math, coding, reasoning, science, and visual understanding capabilities. The o4-mini model offers a balance between price, speed, and performance. Both models can generate responses using tools in ChatGPT such as web browsing, Python code execution, image processing, and image generation. These models, along with a variant of o4-mini called "o4-mini-high", are now available for subscribers to OpenAI's Pro, Plus, and Team plans. The launch of these models is part of OpenAI's efforts to compete with other tech giants in the global AI race.


#### [Google‚Äôs newest Gemini AI model focuses on efficiency](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/googles-newest-gemini-ai-model-focuses-on-efficiency/)

Google is set to launch its new AI model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, on its AI development platform, Vertex AI. The model is designed for efficiency and dynamic computing, allowing developers to adjust processing time based on the complexity of queries. Gemini 2.5 Flash is a reasoning model, similar to OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek's R1, which takes longer to answer questions as it fact-checks itself. It is ideal for high-volume and real-time applications like customer service and document parsing. Google also plans to bring Gemini models like 2.5 Flash to on-premises environments starting in Q3, with the models being available on Google Distributed Cloud (GDC), in collaboration with Nvidia.


#### [Google rolls out its latest AI video generator to Gemini Advanced subscribers](https://www.theverge.com/news/648816/google-veo-2-ai-video-generation-gemini-advanced)

Google has introduced Veo 2, an advanced text-to-video AI model, to its Gemini Advanced subscribers. The AI model is capable of generating high-resolution, eight-second videos in 720p from a text prompt, with a monthly limit on the number of videos that can be created. The videos, which are output in MP4 format, can be directly uploaded to TikTok and YouTube from mobile devices. Google claims that Veo 2 has an improved understanding of real-world physics and human motion, resulting in more lifelike scenes and fluid character movements. Alongside Veo 2, Google is also offering Whisk Animate, a tool that transforms images into videos, to Google One AI Premium subscribers.
