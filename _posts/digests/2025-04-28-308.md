Baidu has introduced ERNIE X1 Turbo and 4.5 Turbo, two enhanced models of its existing ERNIE X1 and 4.5, offering high performance at significantly reduced costs. ERNIE X1 Turbo, a deep-thinking reasoning model, excels in complex tasks requiring sophisticated understanding, with improved multimodal functions and refined tool utilisation abilities. It also undercuts competitor pricing, costing approximately 25% of DeepSeek R1. ERNIE 4.5 Turbo, on the other hand, focuses on upgraded multimodal features and faster response times, achieving an 80% price reduction compared to the original ERNIE 4.5. In performance benchmarks, ERNIE 4.5 Turbo outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-4o model. These launches signify a trend towards democratising high-end AI capabilities, putting pressure on competitors like OpenAI and DeepSeek.


#### [The Leaderboard Illusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20879v1)


The article discusses the issues with the Chatbot Arena, a leaderboard for generative AI models. The authors argue that the over-reliance on a single leaderboard can lead to overfitting and gaming of the system, rather than genuine technological advancement. They conducted a systematic review of the Chatbot Arena, analyzing data from 2 million battles, 42 providers, and 243 models over a fixed time period. Their analysis revealed that a small group of preferred providers were given disproportionate access to data and testing, and that there were significant data asymmetries between proprietary, open-weight, and open-source model providers. They also found that the Arena's deprecation policies led to unreliable model rankings. The authors suggest that these issues could be addressed through interventions by the organizers to restore scientific accuracy and trust in the leaderboard.

#### [OpenAI undoes its glaze-heavy ChatGPT update](https://www.theverge.com/news/658315/openai-chatgpt-gpt-4o-roll-back-glaze-update)

OpenAI has decided to roll back its latest GPT-4o update due to concerns over the chatbot's excessively agreeable and flattering personality. The decision was announced by CEO Sam Altman, who acknowledged the chatbot's "sycophant-y and annoying" behavior. The rollback process has been completed for free ChatGPT users and is expected to be done for paid users soon. OpenAI is also working on additional fixes to address the personality model of the chatbot, with more details to be shared in the coming days.
