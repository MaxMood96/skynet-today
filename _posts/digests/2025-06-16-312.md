#### [Meta Is Creating a New A.I. Lab to Pursue â€˜Superintelligenceâ€™](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/technology/meta-new-ai-lab-superintelligence.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/10/multimedia/10meta-ai-jgql/10meta-ai-jgql-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Meta, the tech giant that owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is set to launch a new artificial intelligence (AI) research lab focused on developing "superintelligence," an AI system that surpasses human cognitive abilities. The company has recruited Alexandr Wang, founder and CEO of AI start-up Scale AI, to join the new lab and is reportedly in talks to invest billions in his company. As part of the deal, other Scale AI employees may also join Meta. The company has also offered substantial compensation packages to researchers from leading AI companies such as OpenAI and Google.

This move is part of a larger reorganization of Meta's AI initiatives, amid internal management issues, employee turnover, and several unsuccessful product launches. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has invested heavily in transforming Meta into an AI powerhouse, pushing for the integration of AI across its products, including smart glasses and the recently released Meta AI app. This comes in the wake of the tech industry's race to build increasingly powerful AI systems since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in 2022.

#### [Reddit sues Anthropic for allegedly not paying for training data](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/04/reddit-sues-anthropic-for-allegedly-not-paying-for-training-data/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/reddit-ipo-v2.jpg?resize=1200,675)

Reddit has filed a lawsuit against AI startup Anthropic, accusing it of unlawfully using the site's data to train AI models without a proper licensing agreement. The lawsuit marks the first time a major tech company has legally challenged an AI model provider over its data training practices. Reddit alleges that Anthropic violated the site's user agreement by commercially exploiting Reddit content without providing any return for Reddit users or respecting their privacy. The company has previously signed agreements with other AI model providers, such as OpenAI and Google, allowing them to train AI models on Reddit's data under certain terms that protect user interests and privacy.

In the complaint, Reddit claims that it had approached Anthropic to clarify that the startup did not have authorization to scrape or use Reddit's content, but Anthropic allegedly "refused to engage." Reddit also alleges that Anthropic's scraper bots ignored the social network's robots.txt files, a standard that signals to automated systems not to crawl websites. Despite Anthropic's claim to have blocked its bots from scraping Reddit in 2024, Reddit alleges that the bots continued to scrape the platform over 100,000 times. Reddit is seeking compensatory damages and restitution from Anthropic, as well as an injunction prohibiting the startup from continuing to use Reddit's content.

#### [Disney and Universal Sue A.I. Firm for Copyright Infringement](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/business/media/disney-universal-midjourney-ai.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/11/business/11biz-hollywood-ai-03/11biz-hollywood-ai-03-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Disney and Universal have filed a lawsuit against artificial intelligence start-up Midjourney, accusing the company of copyright infringement. The 110-page lawsuit alleges that Midjourney used copyrighted works from both movie companies to train its AI image generator, which has tens of millions of registered users. The software allows users to create images and soon videos that incorporate and copy Disney's and Universal's famous characters.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, labels Midjourney as a "quintessential copyright free-rider" and a "bottomless pit of plagiarism". The case brings Hollywood into the ongoing debate over generative AI and its potential to infringe on copyrighted material. This case could set a precedent for how AI companies use copyrighted content to train their algorithms.

#### [OpenAI adds o3 Pro to ChatGPT and drops o3 price by 80 per cent, but open-source AI is delayed](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openai-adds-o3-pro-to-chatgpt-and-drops-o3-price-by-80-per-cent-but-open-source-ai-is-delayed-2739043-2025-06-11)
#### [AMC Networks is teaming up with AI company Runway](https://www.engadget.com/ai/amc-networks-is-teaming-up-with-ai-company-runway-141959898.html)
![](https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/7f2517f0-bbba-11ea-a9b5-cf0dc107550b)

AMC Networks has partnered with AI company Runway to generate marketing images and pre-visualize projects before they enter production. This move is seen as a cost-saving measure, allowing AMC to produce a range of promotional material without the need for time-consuming and expensive physical shoots. AMC is the first cable company to strike a deal with Runway, although other Hollywood companies such as Lionsgate and EDGELRD have also partnered with the AI firm.

While AMC has no current plans to include AI-generated imagery in its shows, the technology will be used in pre-production to help showrunners determine what may or may not work in their projects before filming starts. This partnership comes after AMC's profits dropped by nearly half to $63 million in its most recent earnings report. The use of AI in marketing and pre-production is seen as a way for the company to maintain quality while reducing the costs of producing and marketing projects.
