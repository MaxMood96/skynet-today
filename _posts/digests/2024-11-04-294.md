Decart, an Israeli AI firm, has launched Oasis, an "open-world" AI model that simulates a real-time, playable version of Minecraft. The model, which was trained on Minecraft gameplay videos, generates frames in real time based on keyboard and mouse movements, simulating the game's physics, rules, and graphics. Despite its current low resolution and tendency to "forget" level layouts, Decart is working on improvements, including the ability to create a custom "world" from an uploaded image. Future versions of Oasis, optimized for Etched's upcoming AI accelerator chips, could potentially generate up to 4K gameplay. However, questions about copyright implications arise as Decart did not mention obtaining Microsoft's permission to train the model on Minecraft footage.

OpenAI has integrated a web search feature into its AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, closing a competitive gap with rivals like Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini. The feature, which can be manually triggered or activated based on queries, allows users to access real-time information during conversations. The search functionality, built with a mix of technologies including Microsoft's Bing, will be available across all ChatGPT platforms and is based on a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o. Despite the new feature, OpenAI will continue to update its training data to ensure users have access to the latest advancements. The launch comes amid a surge in AI-powered search across tech giants, with Meta developing its own solution and Google expanding its AI overview feature.

San Francisco-based startup, Physical Intelligence, is developing an artificial intelligence (AI) model capable of performing a variety of household chores, moving the concept from science fiction to reality. The AI model is trained on an extensive amount of data, similar to large language models (LLMs) used in chatbots, but with a focus on physical tasks. The company's approach involves using data from various types of robots, creating a general-purpose learning algorithm for the physical world. This development, as stated by the company's CEO, Karol Hausman, is akin to training language models, and it brings the prospect of integrating AI models like ChatGPT into the physical world.
