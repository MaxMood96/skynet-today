Salesforce, a leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software, has announced a significant update to its artificial intelligence (AI) suite, Einstein, at the Dreamforce 2023 conference. The update introduces Einstein Copilot, a generative AI conversational assistant integrated into Salesforce's CRM and all supported apps. The assistant can perform a variety of application-specific tasks, and can be customized by enterprise customer administrators to access and reference specific data. Einstein Copilot can also utilize third-party Language Learning Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-3.5. The new assistant can automate tasks in sales, service, marketing, commerce, and development, and can be tailored to industry-specific needs. The Einstein Copilot Studio allows for further customization, enabling the creation of chatbots for various consumer-facing channels. The assistant's operations are secured by Salesforce's Einstein Trust Layer, which screens every AI response and records all AI interactions for compliance and auditing purposes.

The California Senate has passed a bill, AB 316, that mandates the presence of a trained human safety operator in self-driving, heavy-duty vehicles on public roads, effectively banning driverless autonomous trucks. The bill, which still requires Governor Gavin Newsom's approval, has been opposed by autonomous vehicle (AV) companies and industry representatives who argue that it undermines the purpose of driverless technology and hampers technological advancement. Supporters of the bill argue that it ensures road safety and job security for truck drivers. The bill also requires the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to provide evidence of safety to policymakers and submit a report evaluating the performance of AV technology by January 1, 2029, or five years after testing begins. The DMV has opposed the bill, stating that it will not increase safety and will hinder the development of technology in California.
