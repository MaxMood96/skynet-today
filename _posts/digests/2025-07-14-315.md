#### [OpenAI‚Äôs Windsurf deal is off ‚Äî and Windsurf‚Äôs CEO is going to Google](https://www.theverge.com/openai/705999/google-windsurf-ceo-openai)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/gettyimages-2224341249.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.752607989199%2C100%2C78.494784021602&w=1200)

OpenAI's planned acquisition of Windsurf has been cancelled, with Google instead hiring Windsurf's CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and several of the company's R&D employees. These new hires will join the Google DeepMind team and focus on agentic coding efforts, primarily working on a project named Gemini. Google will not gain control or a stake in Windsurf, but it will obtain a non-exclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology. 

In the wake of these changes, Windsurf's head of business, Jeff Wang, has stepped into the role of interim CEO, while Graham Moreno, the company's VP of global sales, has been appointed as the new president. The financial details of Google's hiring of the Windsurf team have not been disclosed. Previously, OpenAI was reported to be purchasing Windsurf for $3 billion.

#### [Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI launches Grok 4 alongside a $300 monthly subscription](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-alongside-a-300-monthly-subscription/)

Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, has launched its latest AI model, Grok 4, and a new $300-per-month AI subscription plan, SuperGrok Heavy. Grok 4 is designed to compete with models like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Gemini, with capabilities to analyze images and respond to questions. The model has been integrated into Musk's social network, X, which was recently acquired by xAI. Despite its capabilities, Grok has faced criticism for inappropriate responses, including antisemitic comments, which led to temporary limitations on its account and the removal of a section from its public system prompt encouraging "politically incorrect" claims.

In addition to Grok 4, xAI also launched Grok 4 Heavy, a "multi-agent version" that offers increased performance. According to xAI, Grok 4 outperformed Google‚Äôs Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI‚Äôs o3 on Humanity‚Äôs Last Exam, a challenging test measuring AI‚Äôs ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions. Grok 4 Heavy, with "tools," achieved a score of 44.4%, outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro with tools. The company also launched its most expensive AI subscription plan yet, SuperGrok Heavy, which offers early access to Grok 4 Heavy and new features. Despite its performance on benchmarks, xAI may face challenges due to recent controversies as it tries to position Grok as a competitor to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

#### [Replit Launches New Feature for its Agent, CEO Calls it ‚ÄòDeep Research for Coding‚Äô](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/replit-launches-new-feature-for-its-agent-ceo-calls-it-deep-research-for-coding/)
![](https://analyticsindiamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mohit-34-1300x731.jpg)

Replit has announced three new features for its coding assistant, Replit Agent, as part of a broader capability upgrade named 'Dynamic Intelligence'. The new features, Extended Thinking, High Power Model, and Web Search, are designed to enhance the agent's context awareness, step-by-step reasoning, and autonomous problem-solving capabilities. The Web Search feature allows the agent to intelligently query the internet to fill knowledge gaps, while the Extended Thinking mode prompts the agent to display its reasoning process before presenting final outputs. The High Power Model uses advanced AI to improve accuracy in complex workflows.

The new features can be toggled on a per-request basis, providing flexibility depending on the complexity of the task. This update is part of Replit's ongoing effort to make its AI assistant more autonomous and developer-friendly, as it competes with other tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor. The company recently reported $100 million in annual recurring revenue, a tenfold increase since 2021. The CEO of Replit, Amjad Masad, described the new features as "deep research but for coding", indicating a shift from mere code suggestions to real-time, goal-driven programming assistance.

#### [Perplexity launches Comet, an AI-powered web browser](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181313521.jpg?w=1024)

Perplexity has launched Comet, its first AI-powered web browser, in a bid to challenge Google Search as the primary online information source. Initially available to subscribers of Perplexity‚Äôs $200-per-month Max plan and a select group of invitees, Comet's key feature is Perplexity‚Äôs AI search engine, which is pre-installed and set as the default. The browser also includes Comet Assistant, a new AI agent that can automate routine tasks such as summarizing emails and calendar events, managing tabs, and navigating web pages. Users can access Comet Assistant via a sidecar on any web page, allowing the AI agent to view the page and answer questions about it.

Despite entering a crowded market dominated by Google Chrome and Apple‚Äôs Safari, Comet could gain an advantage if a significant number of Perplexity users sign up for the product. The company reported 780 million queries in May 2025, with its search products seeing over 20% growth month-on-month. However, the most unique aspect of Comet is the Comet Assistant, which, despite requiring significant access to user data, has proven useful for simple tasks. However, it struggles with more complex requests, indicating that AI agents still have a long way to go before they can handle intricate tasks.
