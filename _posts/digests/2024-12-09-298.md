Google has announced Gemini 2, an upgraded version of its flagship AI model, designed to perform tasks on users' computers and the web, and interact like a human. The model has improved multimodal abilities, enhancing its skills in interpreting video and audio, and engaging in speech. Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, emphasized the company's focus on developing more "agentic" models that can understand the world, plan ahead, and act on behalf of users. Alongside Gemini 2, Google introduced two specialized AI agents for coding and data science, and showcased Project Mariner, a Chrome extension capable of web navigation to perform tasks for users, demonstrating the potential of AI agents to revolutionize personal computing.

Amazon has unveiled a new series of AI foundation models, known as "Nova", which will be part of the Amazon Bedrock model library in AWS. The Nova series includes three "understanding" models: Nova Micro, a text model optimized for speed and cost; Nova Lite, a low-cost multimodal model that processes images, video, and text; and Nova Pro, a highly capable multimodal model. Amazon is also developing Nova Premier, a multimodal model for complex reasoning tasks, set to be available in early 2025. Additionally, Amazon is releasing content generation models, Nova Canvas for image generation, and Nova Reel for video generation, both with watermarking capabilities to promote responsible AI use. The company also plans to release a speech-to-speech model and a native multimodal-to-multimodal model later in 2025. These announcements were made at the AWS re:Invent conference, where Amazon also revealed its partnership with Anthropic to build a massive AI compute cluster using its Trainium 2 chips.

#### [OpenAIâ€™s video generator Sora is launching today](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317090/openai-sora-text-to-video-ai-generator-confirmed-release)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hekdRK41i5u4Mvg0X3StZMdu1F4=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25461999/STK155_OPEN_AI_CVirginia_A.jpg)

OpenAI's AI text-to-video generator, Sora, is now available to the public. Initially revealed in February and tested by a select group of visual artists, designers, and filmmakers, Sora can convert text prompts into videos, transform photos into videos, and use its storyboard feature to create cohesive scenes from multiple text prompts. However, as noted by tech reviewer Marques Brownlee, the tool currently has limitations, including difficulty generating realistic physics and a tendency to reject prompts involving public figures or copyrighted characters. Despite these challenges, Brownlee described the results of using Sora as both "horrifying and inspiring."

#### [Meta unveils a new, more efficient Llama model](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/06/meta-unveils-a-new-more-efficient-llama-model/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-959993436-e1718640411389.jpg?resize=1200,675)

Meta has introduced a new, more efficient generative AI model, Llama 3.3 70B, which outperforms its largest model, Llama 3.1 405B, at a lower cost. The new model has shown superior performance on industry benchmarks, including MMLU, which assesses a model's language understanding capabilities, compared to Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro, OpenAI's GPT-4o, and Amazon's Nova Pro. Despite restrictions on usage by platforms with over 700 million monthly users, Llama models have been downloaded over 650 million times and power Meta's AI assistant, which has nearly 600 million monthly active users. However, Meta has faced challenges with the open nature of Llama, including allegations of misuse by Chinese military researchers and difficulties in complying with EU regulations on AI and data privacy. To support future Llama models, Meta is investing in a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana and has procured over 100,000 Nvidia GPUs for model development.
