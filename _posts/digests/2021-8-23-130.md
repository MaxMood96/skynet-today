#### [100+ Sandford Researchers Publish 200+ Page Paper on the AI Paradigm Shift Introduced by Large-Scale Models](https://syncedreview.com/2021/08/19/deepmind-podracer-tpu-based-rl-frameworks-deliver-exceptional-performance-at-low-cost-86/)

Last week a large group of AI researchers from Stanford published a review paper on what they call foundation models, the type of large-scale machine learning models popularized over the last two years, like OpenAI's GPT-3.
The study gives an in-depth discussion of future opportunities as well as risks of scaling up such models.
In particular, it seems like there is a trend of homogenoization in AI applications, where many fields, from speech and vision to healthcare and robotics, are adopting the use of large models.
Such homogenoization is beneficial for domains where task-specific data is limited.
However, it also amplifies the inherent risks of such approaches, like bias and poor explainability.
The Stanford researchers also started a workshop on foundation models to advance both the development and deployment of these models in the future.
