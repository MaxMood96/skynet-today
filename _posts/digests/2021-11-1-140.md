#### [Adobe's Project Morpheus is Actually a Deepfake Tool?](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/267199/20211027/adobes-new-project-morpheus-deepfake-tool-experts-claim-heres-why.htm)

On Oct. 28 Adobe announced a new AI-powered video editing tool called Project Morpheus. It can be used to edit people's expressions and other facial attributes. This continues Adobe’s efforts to introduce AI tools to its image and video editing software, with [Neural Filters](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21517616/adobe-photoshop-ai-neural-filters-beta-launch-machine-learning) having already been added to photoshop last year. The tool only allows users to tweak faces rather than larger manipulations such as face swapping, though it is likely to expand in scope. This led some to be concerned with it being used for malicious ends, as with ‘DeepFake’ software.

#### [Clearview AI finally takes part in a federal accuracy test.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/technology/clearview-ai-test.html)

If you've heard Hoan Ton-That talk about Clearview AI, it's clear he wants you to believe that his algorithm rarely, if ever, gets things wrong. But can we trust his words? It seems we no longer have to: more than two years since law enforcement officers started using the company's algorithm, it has finally been subjected to a third-party test. While Clearview performed very well--it stood among the top 10 out of more than 300 algorithms from over 200 facial recognition vendors--the test focused on how well algorithms could match two photos of the same person and not how well they could find a match for an unknown face in a large database. The latter task will be a more reliable indicator of how Clearview stands up, and Hoan Ton-That has said Clearview will be submitting to this one-to-many test soon. Clearview AI has been sued in court for collecting people's photos without their consent and continues to be mired in controversy. Perhaps the company's results will speak up for it.

#### [How AI could solve supply chain shortages and save Christmas](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/26/1038643/ai-reinforcement-learning-digital-twins-can-solve-supply-chain-shortages-and-save-christmas/)

Weaknesses and the brittlness of current global supply chains have become apparent in recent months due to a myriad of factors, including Covid-induced labor shortages.
Looking toward the future, many companies are embracing the idea of combining supply chain simulations ("digital twins") and AI-based software that can learn from these simulations to better predict potential disruptions and respond to them in a proactive way.
Complex supply chain simulations has only become possible recently with more companies logging real-time data and acquiring more compute power.
These simulations include information about inventory and shipping, consumer behavior, market and financial projections, weather, and geopolitical and socioeconomic trends.
Big companies like Amazon, Google, FedEx, and DHL have their own simulation software, while smaller companies can look to third-party providers like Pathmind for similar tools
AI-based software can leverage these simulations by asking "what if" questions, forecasting outcomes based on different scenarios, and optimize for the best ways to respond.
As supply chains get more complex in the future, such tools will only become more necessary.
