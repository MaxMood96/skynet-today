### Mini Briefs

#### [Who am I to decide when algorithms should make important decisions?](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/11/02/opinion/who-am-i-decide-when-algorithms-should-make-important-decisions/)
As AI systems are being incorporated into production systems and making more decisions that impact our daily lives, it's important to start incorporating the voices of the people that these decisions directly impact. The grocery platform Shipt recently implemented a new algorithm that automatically determines Shipt worker's schedules and wages. Many workers complain about reduces wages as well as unpredictable scheduling. The decision about whether or not AI-powered decision systems are used is solely determined by corporations or government institutions where the primary benefactors are themselves. Furthermore, claims of "fairness" and transparency are often unsubstantiated and presented without evidence or verification. The article explores the voices and perspectives of people directly impacted by AI systems' decisions and advocates for the inclusion of these people into discussions about the appropriate use of AI. 


#### [AI godfather Geoff Hinton: “Deep learning is going to be able to do everything”](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/03/1011616/ai-godfather-geoffrey-hinton-deep-learning-will-do-everything/)

Geoffrey Hinton, a Turing Award Winner and an AI Pioneer, believes that the technique of deep learning will be sufficient to achieve AGI (artificial general intelligence). He believes that while key conceptual breakthroughs are necessary (e.g., new architecture breakthroughs similar to transformers in NLP), bridging these conceptual gaps and scaling up existing architectures should be sufficient to achieve the goals of AI research. He states that neural networks with a massive number of parameters are good at dealing with small amounts of data. However, there is still a gap between human-level performance and neural networks. Hinton believes that by adopting neural networks as the primary framework, we can achieve most of the goals of AI, such as truly universal intelligence.
