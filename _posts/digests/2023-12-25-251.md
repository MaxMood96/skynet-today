#### [AI image training dataset found to include child sexual abuse imagery](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/20/24009418/generative-ai-image-laion-csam-google-stability-stanford)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AZHeeAhRbTyyp3nERayicH3uROo=/0x0:5000x3333/1200x628/filters:focal(774x143:775x144)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25176378/1801115698.jpg)

The article discusses how a popular AI image training dataset, LAION-5B, used for creating AI models, was found to contain links to child sexual abuse imagery. The dataset, used by Stability AI, included at least 1,679 illegal images scraped from social media and adult websites. Researchers from Stanfordâ€™s Internet Observatory investigated the dataset and found the presence of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) through image identifiers and verification by CSAM detection platforms. While the dataset does not store the images, it contains links to them. The report highlighted concerns about the potential influence of such content on AI models trained on the dataset. LAION, the nonprofit managing the dataset, and Stability AI have taken steps to address the issue, but there are calls for further investigation and regulation to prevent the creation of AI-generated CSAM.

#### [Anthropic will help users if they get sued for copyright infringement.](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/19/24008168/anthropic-will-help-users-if-they-get-sued-for-copyright-infringement)

Anthropic, a company offering an AI chatbot named Claude, has updated its commercial terms of service to include defense and settlement payment for customers facing copyright infringement claims. This update, effective from January 1st, 2024, aligns with similar commitments from tech giants like Microsoft and Google. However, the copyright protections will not apply if the customer is aware or should reasonably be aware of the infringement. This stance is consistent with Anthropic's previous position expressed to the US Copyright Office, emphasizing the prevention of copyrighted work infringement by users.

#### [Midjourney V6 is here with in-image text and completely overhauled prompting](https://venturebeat.com/ai/midjourney-v6-is-here-with-in-image-text-and-completely-overhauled-prompting/)

Midjourney V6, the latest version of the popular image generation AI model, has been released with significant improvements. The new features include more realistic and detailed images, the ability to generate legible text within images, and improved prompting methods. Users can enable V6 by typing a specific command in the Midjourney Discord server or using the website. However, the new prompting method requires users to be more explicit and avoid certain terms that were previously effective. Initial testing has shown increased detail and photorealism in the generated images, with promising results for text generation. Despite some missing features from the previous version, V6 is expected to undergo frequent changes and updates. This release solidifies Midjourney's position as a leading AI art generator, despite facing competition and legal challenges related to copyright infringement.
