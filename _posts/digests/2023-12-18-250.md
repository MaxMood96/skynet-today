#### [Phi-2: The surprising power of small language models](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models/)
![](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2023/12/Phi2-TWLIFB-1200x627-1.jpg)

Microsoft Research has released Phi-2, a small language model (SLM) with 2.7 billion parameters that demonstrates outstanding reasoning and language understanding capabilities. Phi-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among base language models with less than 13 billion parameters, matching or outperforming models up to 25 times larger. The key insights behind Phi-2 include focusing on high-quality training data, including synthetic datasets for common sense reasoning and carefully selected web data, and using innovative techniques to scale up from the previous Phi-1.5 model. Phi-2 is available in the Azure AI Studio model catalog for research and development purposes.

#### [Meet Mixtral 8x7b: The Revolutionary Language Model from Mistral that Surpasses GPT-3.5 in Open-Access AI](https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/12/13/meet-mixtral-8x7b-the-revolutionary-language-model-from-mistral-that-surpasses-gpt-3-5-in-open-access-ai/)
![](https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-13-at-9.08.06-AM.png)

Mixtral 8x7b is a revolutionary language model developed by Mistral AI that surpasses GPT-3.5 in open-access AI. It utilizes a sparse Mixture of Expert (MoE) layer, replacing feed-forward layers, and has eight expert models within a single framework. The MoE allows for exceptional performance and enables models to be pretrained with less computational power. The model has a context length capacity of 32,000 tokens and performs well in various languages and coding tasks. Mixtral Instruct, a variant of the model, excels in industry standards and demonstrates flexibility in prompt formats. While some details about the model's datasets and fine-tuning methods are still unknown, Mixtral 8x7b has the potential to revolutionize various fields such as research, education, and healthcare.

#### [Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752v1)
![](https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2312.00752/gradient.png)

The article titled "Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces" introduces a new approach called Mamba for sequence modeling. Mamba is designed to efficiently handle long sequences by selectively attending to relevant parts of the input. It achieves this by using a hierarchical structure that allows for linear-time computation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba on various tasks, including language modeling and machine translation, and show that it outperforms existing models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

#### [Deepfakes for $24 a month: how AI is disrupting Bangladesh‚Äôs election](https://www.ft.com/content/bd1bc5b4-f540-48f8-9cda-75c19e5ac69c)
![](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftlogo-v1%3Abrand-ft-logo-square-coloured?source=update-logos&format=svg)

This article discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to disrupt elections in Bangladesh through the creation of deepfake videos. Deepfakes are manipulated videos that use AI algorithms to superimpose someone's face onto another person's body, creating a realistic but fake video. In Bangladesh, political parties are reportedly using deepfakes to spread misinformation and manipulate public opinion during election campaigns. The article highlights how these deepfakes can be created for as little as $24 a month, making them accessible to anyone with a computer and internet connection. This raises concerns about the potential impact of deepfakes on the democratic process and the need for regulations to address this issue.
