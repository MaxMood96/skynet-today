OpenAI‚Äôs DevDay 2025 reframed ChatGPT as an app platform and agent OS, debuting Apps inside ChatGPT, a preview Apps SDK, and AgentKit. Apps run directly in ChatGPT responses with interactive UIs, video, login, and actions via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Launch partners include Canva, Zillow, Coursera, Figma, Spotify, Booking.com, and Expedia, with DoorDash, Instacart, Uber, and AllTrails ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù Live demos showcased end-to-end ‚Äútalking to apps‚Äù: generating a poster in Canva, auto-building a pitch deck, and pulling Zillow listings with natural-language filters and maps, including full‚Äëscreen renders inside ChatGPT. App monetization will use Instant Checkout, and privacy rules require minimal data collection with transparent permissions, though clarity on conversation access is still pending.

AgentKit rolled out alongside Agent Builder (a visual ‚ÄúCanva for agents‚Äù), ChatKit (an embeddable chat UI), Evals for Agents (step-trace grading, datasets, automated prompt optimization, external-model evals), and a Connectors registry with admin controls. A live demo built two production agents and guardrails in under eight minutes. Codex moved from research preview to general availability, with on‚Äëstage demos wiring a camera to an Xbox 360 controller, building a voice assistant for lights, and auto‚Äëgenerating overlays, countdowns, and a group photo. New API models include GPT‚Äë5 Pro for high‚Äëaccuracy, deep‚Äëreasoning use cases; Sora 2 video (preview) with synchronized audio, physical consistency, and granular camera control; and gpt‚Äërealtime‚Äëmini, a low‚Äëlatency voice model ‚Äú70% cheaper‚Äù than the prior advanced voice model. Altman also said ChatGPT now reaches 800M weekly active users, 4M developers, and 6B tokens per minute on the API, with developer app submissions for review opening later this year.

 * [Broadcom stock pops 9% on OpenAI custom chip deal, adding to Nvidia and AMD agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/13/openai-partners-with-broadcom-custom-ai-chips-alongside-nvidia-amd.html)

![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/13openai-broadcom-wqpc/13openai-broadcom-wqpc-facebookJumbo.jpg)

OpenAI signed a deal with Broadcom to co‚Äëdesign and deploy custom AI accelerators, aiming to roll out racks of OpenAI‚Äëdesigned chips starting late next year. The systems will integrate compute, memory, and networking on Broadcom‚Äôs Ethernet stack, targeting major efficiency gains for OpenAI‚Äôs workloads while reducing reliance on Nvidia and AMD. The partnership fits into a plan to build roughly 10 gigawatts of compute capacity, with OpenAI already constructing a data center in Abilene, Texas and planning additional sites in Texas, New Mexico, Ohio, and the Midwest. Industry estimates put a 1‚Äëgigawatt AI data center at around $50 billion‚Äîabout $35 billion of which is chips at current Nvidia pricing‚Äîhighlighting how custom silicon could significantly cut compute costs.

The company also has large agreements with Nvidia, Oracle, and AMD. Nvidia said it intends to invest $100 billion, and AMD effectively granted 160 million shares (around 10% of AMD) to support OpenAI‚Äôs buildout‚Äîwhile Broadcom is not investing equity. Broadcom‚Äôs custom AI chips (XPUs) have strong demand from hyperscalers, and its stock jumped about 9.9% on the news; however, Broadcom clarified OpenAI is not the previously disclosed $10 billion customer. OpenAI executives said they used their own models to accelerate chip design and achieve ‚Äúmassive area reductions,‚Äù while Broadcom‚Äôs Hock Tan emphasized that owning custom chips lets OpenAI secure ‚Äúthe best, latest compute capacity‚Äù for frontier models. Altman added that OpenAI currently runs just over 2 GW, has announced about 33 GW in recent commitments across partners, and expects demand to saturate even 30 GW quickly as it pushes toward higher‚Äëperformance, faster, and cheaper models.

 * [Sora copycats flooded Apple‚Äôs App Store, and some still remain](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/sora-copycats-flooded-apples-app-store-and-some-still-remain/)

OpenAI faced intense scrutiny over Sora‚Äôs training data and copyright handling, prompting a shift in its public stance as legal and public‚Äërelations pressures mounted. The launch sparked rapid user adoption, propelled the app to the top of the U.S. App Store, and also triggered a wave of copycat apps. Commentary from Altman and reporting from multiple outlets underscore how copyright risk, user demand, and platform governance are intersecting for Sora‚Äôs rapid rollout.

#### [Anthropic launches Claude Haiku 4.5, a smaller, cheaper AI model](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/anthropic-claude-haiku-4-5-ai.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108181967-1758834890156-GettyImages-2194795244.jpg?v=1760539777&w=1920&h=1080)

Anthropic introduced Claude Haiku 4.5, its smallest and most affordable Claude 4.x model, now available to all users including on the free tier. The company says Haiku 4.5 is notably fast and ‚Äúpunches above its weight,‚Äù outperforming older larger models and even surpassing Claude Sonnet 4 on computer‚Äëuse tasks. On coding, Haiku 4.5 scores comparably to Claude Sonnet 4 and OpenAI‚Äôs GPT‚Äë5 on SWE‚Äëbench Verified, a benchmark for real‚Äëworld bug fixing. Pricing-wise, Haiku models run at about one‚Äëthird the cost of Sonnet, and Sonnet is roughly one‚Äëfifth the cost of Opus‚Äîmaking Haiku 4.5 the lowest‚Äëcost paid option while granting more capacity to free users due to its smaller size.

While Claude Sonnet 4.5 remains Anthropic‚Äôs overall top performer, Haiku 4.5 targets fast, accurate responses and high‚Äëthroughput workloads. Anthropic highlights complementary workflows: Sonnet 4.5 can devise multi‚Äëstep plans for complex problems, while Haiku 4.5 handles parallelizable subtasks or continuous monitoring at scale, handing off insights for deeper analysis. The release follows Sonnet 4.5 (September) and Opus 4.1 (August), with an updated Opus targeted for late 2024 or early 2025. Anthropic, valued at $183 billion with a revenue run rate nearing $7 billion and over 300,000 business customers, is accelerating launches amid competition with Google and OpenAI, which released GPT‚Äë5 and expanded with infrastructure deals and Sora.

#### [Google releases Veo 3.1, adds it to Flow video editor](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/google-releases-veo-3-1-adds-it-to-flow-video-editor/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-15-at-8.03.20PM.jpg?resize=1200,578)

Google rolled out Veo 3.1, an upgrade to its Veo 3 video generation model, focused on higher‚Äëfidelity visuals, stronger prompt adherence, and richer editing controls. The update improves image‚Äëto‚Äëvideo quality and introduces better audio output, adding synchronized audio to features like reference‚Äëimage character control, first/last‚Äëframe guided clip generation, and clip extension from trailing frames. Veo 3.1 also supports granular edits, including adding objects that blend into a clip‚Äôs visual style, with object removal coming soon in Flow. The new model is available now in Flow, the Gemini app, and via Vertex and Gemini APIs.

Flow, Google‚Äôs video editor, now integrates Veo 3.1 directly, enabling multimodal edits with audio across core workflows. Users can guide generation with stylistic references, constrain motion via keyframes (first/last frame), and extend existing footage while maintaining continuity, now with audio‚Äëaware outputs. Object insertion aligns with a clip‚Äôs look and lighting to improve compositing realism; object removal is slated for near‚Äëterm release. Since launching in May, Flow has been used to create over 275 million videos, and Veo 3.1 aims to refine that pipeline with more controllable, prompt‚Äëfaithful results.

#### Research

[Evolution Strategies at Scale: LLM Fine-Tuning Beyond Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24372). This paper presents a memory‚Äëefficient, highly parallel evolution strategies implementation that directly searches billions of model parameters for LLM fine‚Äëtuning, showing better sample efficiency, robustness, and stability than reinforcement learning on outcome‚Äëonly reasoning tasks.

[Reasoning with Sampling: Your Base Model is Smarter Than You Think](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14901). Using a training‚Äëfree MCMC sampling method targeting a ‚Äúpower distribution‚Äù over base‚Äëmodel outputs, the authors show inference‚Äëtime sampling can match or exceed RL post‚Äëtraining (GRPO) on single‚Äëshot and out‚Äëof‚Äëdomain reasoning tasks while preserving multi‚Äësample diversity.

[Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364). The authors argue that much of ‚Äúthinking model‚Äù advantage comes from learning when to activate reasoning behaviors that base models already possess, enabling steered base models to recover most of the benchmark performance gap via a small fraction of targeted activation edits.

[The Art of Scaling Reinforcement Learning Compute for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13786). A predictive sigmoid‚Äëlike scaling framework and an RL recipe called ScaleRL‚Äîvalidated across hundreds of thousands of GPU‚Äëhours‚Äîlet researchers extrapolate RL performance from small runs, identify scalable methods, and improve asymptotic performance and compute efficiency.

[How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11495). When pretraining data include rare but detailed chain‚Äëof‚Äëthought demonstrations, applying RL with a correctness reward rapidly up‚Äëweights those long solutions, causing models to generate longer reasoning chains and generalize to hard tasks that next‚Äëtoken prediction alone fails to learn.

[Memory as Action: Autonomous Context Curation for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12635). MemAct treats memory curation as explicit editing actions and pairs it with a Dynamic Context Policy Optimization algorithm so agents can autonomously manage and optimize working memory for long‚Äëhorizon tasks while controlling token and latency costs.

[Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171). Verbalized Sampling is a prompting technique that asks models to output multiple responses with probabilities, countering typicality bias in preference data and recovering pretrained diversity without retraining.

[Cautious Weight Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402). The method applies decay only to parameter dimensions where the optimizer update has the same sign, improving convergence and final validation loss for AdamW, Lion, and Muon without extra hyperparameters.

[Provable Scaling Laws of Feature Emergence from Learning Dynamics of Grokking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21519v3). A three‚Äëstage gradient‚Äëdynamics framework for two‚Äëlayer nonlinear networks proves how and when hidden‚Äëlayer features emerge, how their stability depends on training‚Äëset size, and how this yields scaling laws predicting grokking, generalization, and memorization.

[Can GenAI Improve Academic Performance? Evidence from the Social and Behavioral Sciences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02408). Using author‚Äëlevel panel data and a difference‚Äëin‚Äëdifferences design, the study finds that researchers who began using GenAI after ChatGPT‚Äôs release increased publication output‚Äîespecially early‚Äëcareer and non‚ÄëEnglish‚Äëspeaking authors‚Äîand saw a modest rise in average journal impact.

[Sycophantic AI Decreases Prosocial Intentions and Promotes Dependence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01395). Experimental evidence suggests that AI systems exhibiting excessive agreeableness can reduce users‚Äô willingness to help others and increase reliance on the system.
