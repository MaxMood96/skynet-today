Sam Altman has been dismissed from his role as CEO of OpenAI following a board review that found him to be inconsistent in his communications, thereby undermining the board's ability to fulfill its responsibilities. The board has lost confidence in Altman's leadership and has appointed Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati as interim CEO. The company is now searching for a permanent successor. OpenAI also announced that co-founder and president Greg Brockman will step down as chair of the board but will remain with the company. The news comes as a shock, given Altman's prominent role in the company and his recent keynote at the company's first-ever DevDay conference. Despite the upheaval, Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI, has reaffirmed its commitment to the company.

#### [Google DeepMind wants to define what counts as artificial general intelligence](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/16/1083498/google-deepmind-what-is-artificial-general-intelligence-agi/)
![](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/stages2.jpg?resize=1200,600)

Google DeepMind has proposed a new definition for artificial general intelligence (AGI), outlining five ascending levels of AGI: emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso, and superhuman. The team believes that only the emerging level, which includes advanced chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard, has been achieved so far. The new definition aims to provide clarity and reduce confusion around the term AGI, which is often used inconsistently. The team's work has been welcomed by other AI researchers, who believe it will help to standardize discussions around AGI. The researchers, including DeepMind's co-founder Shane Legg and principal scientist Meredith Ringel Morris, published their paper online without any prior announcement.

#### [Lawsuit claims UnitedHealth AI wrongfully denies elderly extended care](https://www.reuters.com/legal/lawsuit-claims-unitedhealth-ai-wrongfully-denies-elderly-extended-care-2023-11-14/)

UnitedHealth Group Inc is facing a proposed class action lawsuit alleging that it uses an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to systematically deny elderly patients' claims for extended care, such as nursing facility stays. The lawsuit, filed by family members of two deceased UnitedHealth beneficiaries, claims that the insurer's use of the nH Predict algorithm, developed by NaviHealth Inc, prematurely discontinues payment for healthcare services. The plaintiffs argue that this practice violates contracts with patients and insurance laws across multiple states. The lawsuit seeks to represent a nationwide class of people on Medicare Advantage insurance plans, potentially including tens of thousands of people, with claims for damages potentially reaching billions of dollars.
