#### [Introducing Devin, the first AI software engineer](https://www.cognition-labs.com/blog)
![](https://assets-global.website-files.com/65cf071d26e52092bc212f6e/65ebfb01903f6292418aa675_Artboard%201%20(2).png)

Devin, the world's first fully autonomous AI software engineer, has been introduced by Cognition, an applied AI lab. Devin is capable of planning and executing complex engineering tasks, learning over time, and fixing mistakes. It can also use common developer tools and actively collaborate with users. Devin's abilities include learning unfamiliar technologies, building and deploying apps end-to-end, autonomously finding and fixing bugs in codebases, training and fine-tuning its own AI models, and contributing to mature production repositories. Devin was evaluated on the SWE-bench benchmark, resolving 13.86% of real-world GitHub issues, far exceeding the previous state-of-the-art of 1.96%. Cognition is currently offering early access to Devin for engineering work.


#### [A generalist AI agent for 3D virtual environments](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/sima-generalist-ai-agent-for-3d-virtual-environments/)
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2GNumOaJCB48RQIFbwJmmZro-AFdBebufxvY_ZkSdUs9RQ-0nSTgBMXuhUdIE5zpPknqevL4ZyP44PLOpJlg0U0ArlOCcJHfoOagzSnZZoXLnq7hdQ=w1200-h630-n-nu)

Google DeepMind has introduced a new generalist AI agent, the Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent (SIMA), capable of following natural-language instructions to perform tasks in various video game environments. SIMA, which doesn't require access to a game's source code or APIs, uses pre-trained vision models and a main model that includes a memory and outputs keyboard and mouse actions. The agent was trained and tested on nine different video games in collaboration with eight game studios, demonstrating its ability to understand a broad range of gaming worlds. The research aims to translate the capabilities of advanced AI models into useful, real-world actions through a language interface, with the ultimate goal of creating AI systems that can understand and safely carry out a wide range of tasks in a way that is helpful to people online and in the real world.


#### [Redditâ€™s Sale of User Data for AI Training Draws FTC Inquiry](https://www.wired.com/story/reddits-sale-user-data-ai-training-draws-ftc-investigation/)
![](https://media.wired.com/photos/65f4c15023b4313d476b7a44/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Reddit-FTC-Questioning-Business-1636801576.jpg)

Reddit, ahead of its IPO, has disclosed that it could generate $203 million in revenue over the next few years by licensing user posts to Google and others for AI projects. However, this new business line has drawn the attention of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which has sent a letter to Reddit inquiring about the sale, licensing, or sharing of user-generated content with third parties for AI training. The FTC, which has the power to sanction companies for unfair or deceptive trade practices, is interested in the privacy risks, fairness, and copyright issues surrounding this practice. Reddit is not the only company involved in data licensing for AI, with Stack Overflow, the Associated Press, and Tumblr owner Automattic also engaging in similar deals. The use of online data for AI training has raised questions about content ownership, fairness of licensing without compensating creators, potential data leaks, and the risk of further empowering dominant companies.


#### [Open Release of Grok-1](https://x.ai/blog/grok-os)
![](https://x.ai/favicon.ico)

xAI has announced the open release of Grok-1, a large language model with a 314 billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts model. The model, which was trained from scratch, is not fine-tuned for any specific application, such as dialogue. The base model weights and network architecture are being released under the Apache 2.0 license. Grok-1 was trained using a custom training stack on top of JAX and Rust, with 25% of the weights active on a given token. Instructions for using the model can be found on xAI's GitHub page.
