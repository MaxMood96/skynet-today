#### [AI is making better therapists](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/06/1041345/ai-nlp-mental-health-better-therapists-psychology-cbt/)

Lack of access to quality mental health treatment is a growing problem, and AI-based software might be able to help. 
Companies working in this space have trained language models on therapist-client conversations to classify and analyze these conversations.
For example, these models can identify when the conversations are following CBT (Cognitive Behaviorial Therapy) techniques and guidelines, and when they're not.
Such detailed data analysis can help therapists deliver better care more efficiently.
In the future, AI-assisted therapy may help patients "mix and match treatments" by identifying the "active ingredients" of psychotherapy and providing "precision medicine in psychology and psychiatry."

**Our take**: It is notable that these companies working on AI-assisted therapy are not working on chatbots to replace therapists, which I think many in both the field of AI and field of psychology would agree is counterproductive. Instead, these are AI-based tools that therapists and institutions can use to improve their treatments, a more realistic and promising approach. My main concern, which the article does note, is how doing this analysis requires access to private therapist-client conversations. Obtaining, storing, and using such data in ethical ways seem rather challenging.

#### [US to blacklist Chinese AI company SenseTime over Xinjiang ahead of IPO](https://www.ft.com/content/8ee73509-e364-494e-b4c8-ff9a4f675078)

Clearview isn't the only controversial facial recognition out there. SenseTime, a Chinese facial recognition provider, had plans to go public on the Hong Kong stock exchange on December 17. The US accuses the company of enabling human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and the US Treasury placed SenseTime on a list of "Chinese military-industrial complex companies", adding SenseTime to an investment blacklist. Along with the sanctions and investment setbacks, SenseTime is struggling to keep its IPO afloat as the pricing of its stock offering did not take place as scheduled. SenseTime has spoken up to say the US has a "fundamental misperception" of its business while stressing its commitment to AI ethics and alleging it has merely been caught amidst geopolitical tensions.

**Our take**: It's a good idea for the US--and US companies--to disengage with technology companies / organizations that do not respect the same values that the US does. While I'm all for diplomacy, there is something to sticking by one's principles. Given the Chinese government's deep investment in and engagement with its technology industry, I would give some credence to the US's claims about SenseTime. However, I do hope that doesn't spill over into too general of a skepticism regarding Chinese companies. It would be great if geopolitical tensions didn't hamper the development of technology and the benefits that can accrue from that development. According to Jeffrey Ding, who writes teh ChinAI newsletter, it is still unclear who makes up SenseTime's "much-hyped" AI ethics council. If the lack of transperency is to hide SenseTime's violation of its own core bylaws regarding the composition of the council, it would certainly damage the company's credibility on the ethics front.
