### Top News

#### [Hereâ€™s what we know about generative AIâ€™s impact on white-collar work](https://www.ft.com/content/b2928076-5c52-43e9-8872-08fda2aa2fcf)
![](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/ftlogo-v1%3Abrand-ft-logo-square-coloured?source=update-logos&format=svg)

The article discusses the impact of generative AI on white-collar work. Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create original content, such as writing articles or generating images. The article highlights that while generative AI has the potential to automate certain tasks and improve efficiency in white-collar jobs, it also raises concerns about job displacement and the need for human oversight. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding the limitations and ethical implications of generative AI in order to effectively integrate it into the workplace.

#### [Musk's xAI set to launch first AI model to select group](https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-xai-set-launch-first-ai-model-select-group-2023-11-03/)

Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is set to release its first AI model to a select group on Saturday. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, stated that xAI's new model is the best currently available. The Grok system will be available to all X Premium+ subscribers once it is out of early beta. xAI works closely with Tesla and other companies, and it has signed a contract with Oracle to train its AI model on Oracle's cloud. Musk aims to launch a maximum truth-seeking AI that rivals Google's Bard and Microsoft's Bing AI.

#### [EUâ€™s AI Act negotiations hit the brakes over foundation models](https://www.euractiv.com/section/artificial-intelligence/news/eus-ai-act-negotiations-hit-the-brakes-over-foundation-models/)
![](https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/1686772874427_20230614_EP-152070A_PST_0097-800x450.jpg)

Negotiations on the EU's AI Act have hit a roadblock over the regulation of foundation models. The AI Act is a landmark bill to regulate Artificial Intelligence, and the proposed approach for foundation models has become a sticking point in the negotiations. The EU institutions are currently in the final phase of the legislative process, but unless the deadlock is broken soon, the entire legislation is at risk. The proposed tiered approach for foundation models, which would introduce tighter rules for the most powerful ones, has faced opposition from large European countries such as France, Germany, and Italy. The Spanish presidency has proposed a general rethinking of the provisions on foundation models, but the European Parliament sees regulating foundation models as a red line and without an agreement on this issue, a deal cannot be reached. The next trilogue is scheduled for 6 December, and if no agreement is reached, the entire law might be at risk.

#### [Humaneâ€™s AI Pin: all the news about the new AI-powered wearable](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954497/humane-ai-pin-wearable-news-announcements)

Humane has unveiled the AI Pin, a small AI-powered wearable that aims to reduce smartphone usage. The device can be attached to clothes using a magnetic battery pack and allows users to make phone calls, send texts, play music, and check emails by tapping on it. Additionally, the AI Pin features a laser projector that can display a user interface on the hand for controlling certain functions.
