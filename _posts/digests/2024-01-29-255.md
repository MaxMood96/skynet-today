#### [A ‚ÄòShocking‚Äô Amount of the Web Is Already AI-Translated Trash, Scientists Determine](https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3w4gw/a-shocking-amount-of-the-web-is-already-ai-translated-trash-scientists-determine)
![](https://video-images.vice.com/articles/65a810b91a77481371ba2552/lede/1705514234136-gettyimages-1434945213.jpeg?image-resize-opts=Y3JvcD0xeHc6MC44NDIzeGg7MHh3LDAuMDMwNHhoJnJlc2l6ZT0xMjAwOiomcmVzaXplPTEyMDA6Kg)

A recent study by researchers at the Amazon Web Services AI lab reveals that over half of the sentences on the internet have been translated into two or more languages, often with deteriorating quality due to poor machine translation (MT). The study, which analyzed a corpus of 6.38 billion sentences, found that 57.1% of the sentences were translated into at least three languages. The quality of translations varies significantly, with "low-resource" languages, particularly those spoken in Africa and the Global South, suffering from insufficient training data, resulting in inaccurate text. The study also found a selection bias towards shorter, "more predictable" sentences from low-quality articles, suggesting that a large portion of the internet in lower-resource languages is poorly machine-translated, raising concerns for the development of large language models in these languages.

#### [Self-Rewarding Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10020v1)
The article discusses the concept of Self-Rewarding Language Models (SRLMs), a new approach to improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating a self-improving reward model. Unlike traditional methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which rely on human preference data and often face limitations due to the quality and size of this data, SRLMs continually update the reward model during LLM alignment, eliminating these bottlenecks. The SRLMs act as instruction following models, generating responses for prompts and evaluating new instruction following examples to add to their training set. The article also presents an experiment where a Llama 2 70B model was fine-tuned on Open Assistant, resulting in improved instruction following performance and reward modeling ability. This suggests the potential for developing superior LLMs that can provide higher quality preference datasets to themselves in each iteration of training.

#### [Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft Face FTC Inquiry on AI Partners](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-25/alphabet-amazon-anthropic-microsoft-openai-get-ftc-inquiry-lrthp0es)
![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iW9cKrBVlxAU/v1/1200x800.jpg)
The article discusses an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) into tech giants Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft regarding their partnerships in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The FTC is investigating these companies' AI collaborations to ensure they are not violating any antitrust laws or engaging in anti-competitive practices. The inquiry is part of a broader scrutiny of big tech companies' dominance and influence in various sectors. The outcome of this investigation could have significant implications for the future of AI development and the tech industry as a whole.
