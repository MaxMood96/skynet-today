#### [Can AI Make a Better Fusion Reactor?](https://spectrum.ieee.org/can-ai-make-a-better-fusion-reactor)

Nuclear fusion holds many promises for the future of clean and sustainable energy.
Its development however, has been marred by delays and technical difficulties.
Researchers are now trying to adopt tools from machine learning to help the process. 
For example, AI models can be trained to detect and forecast disruptions in plasma that needs to be stablized for sustained fusion reactions.
Other researchers are focusing on applying AI to speed up complex calculations.
One model was trained to generate complex reaction visualizations in seconds, as opposed to the minutes required by traditional methods.
Another was used to compute the electric field generated by plasma for research.
With these developments, experts note that "AI and machine learning will be a key tool" toward bringing fusion to reality.
