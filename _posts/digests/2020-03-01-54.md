### Mini Briefs

#### [Clearview's Facial Recognition App Has Been Used By The Justice Department, ICE, Macy's, Walmart, And The NBA](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement)

Clearview AI, an American technology company that provides facial recognition technology, has been found to have a number of clients including and besides the law enforcement agencies it claims to target. The company is already under legal threat, and myriad reports and interviews with users such as policemen provide evidence that the company's technology is being used enthusiastically by a number of different actors, sometimes with little concern for the potential impacts of the technology beyond their own use of it. The uses of this technology are concerning and controversial--now that the ubiquity of Clearview's technology has been brought to light, further discussion on this is sure to ensue. The released documents show that the use of Clearview's product extends far beyond governments and law enforcement agencies:

> Employees at big-box retailers, supermarkets, pharmacy chains, and department stores have also trialed Clearview. Company logs reviewed by BuzzFeed News include Walmart (nearly 300 searches), Best Buy (more than 200 searches), grocer Albertsons (more than 40 searches), and Rite Aid (about 35 searches). Kohl’s, which has run more than 2,000 searches across 11 different accounts, and Macy’s, a paying customer that has completed more than 6,000, are among the private companies with the most searches.

#### [Coronavirus is the first big test for futuristic tech that can prevent pandemics](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/27/21156358/surveillance-tech-coronavirus-china-facial-recognition)

With its apparently ceaseless spread, the Coronavirus that appeared in Wuhan, China, late in 2019 is causing global concern. Interestingly, it's also putting a lot of new technology on display: upon walking into a Chinese restaurant in the San Gabriel Valley, one will notice that staff insist on scanning patrons' foreheads with a small device, presumably intended to screen potential customers for the respiratory disease. Beyond these thermometer guns, much more impressive technology is being showcased in the fight against the novel disease. Examples of the uses of AI and high-powered technology in response to the coronavirus include robots and drones used to minimize in-person contact, AI used to study the outbreak's spread and search for treatments, and facial recognition technology being used in places such as Moscow for the purpose of imposing quarantines. Vox comments on the role of surveillance:

> Proponents of surveillance tech focus on threats to peoples’ safety and property, pointing to “dangerous” people like terrorists and sex offenders. Less often, however, do proponents of this technology point to the safety risks associated with a potential pandemic. But now critics of surveillance tech — who have typically argued that the technology threatens our civil liberties and sometimes doesn’t even work — will likely have to push against a different argument: severe threats to public health. It’s ultimately unclear how the public will react to the shifting role of surveillance.
