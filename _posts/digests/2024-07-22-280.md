OpenAI has launched GPT-4o mini, a smaller, faster, and more cost-effective AI model than its predecessors. The model, which outperforms other small AI models in text and vision reasoning tasks, is being made available to developers and consumers via the ChatGPT web and mobile app, with enterprise users gaining access next week. GPT-4o mini scored 82% on the MMLU reasoning benchmark and 87% on the MGSM math reasoning benchmark, outperforming other models like Gemini 1.5 Flash and Claude 3 Haiku. The model is also significantly cheaper to run than previous models, being over 60% cheaper than GPT-3.5 Turbo. OpenAI also announced new tools for enterprise customers to help businesses in regulated industries comply with logging and audit requirements.
