### Top News

#### [Google DeepMindâ€™s new AI models help robots perform physical tasks, even without training](https://www.theverge.com/news/628021/google-deepmind-gemini-robotics-ai-models)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/Apollo-tictactoe.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.4613147178592%2C100%2C93.077370564282&w=1200)

Google DeepMind is introducing two new AI models, Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER, aimed at enhancing the capabilities of robots in performing real-world tasks. Gemini Robotics, built on Google's flagship AI model Gemini 2.0, is a vision-language-action model that can understand and adapt to new situations, even without prior training. It improves robots' generality, interactivity, and dexterity, enabling them to perform precise physical tasks and interact better with their environment. Gemini Robotics-ER, on the other hand, is an advanced visual language model that helps robots understand complex and dynamic environments, aiding them in tasks like packing a lunchbox. Google DeepMind is also developing a layered approach to safety, training the Gemini Robotics-ER models to evaluate the safety of potential actions in given scenarios.

#### [Google calls Gemma 3 the most powerful AI model you can run on one GPU](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/627968/google-gemma-3-open-ai-model)

Google has announced the release of Gemma 3, an updated version of its open AI models, which it claims is the "world's best single-accelerator model". The model is designed for developers creating AI applications that can run on various platforms, from phones to workstations, and supports over 35 languages. It can analyze text, images, and short videos, and has been optimized for running on Nvidia's GPUs and dedicated AI hardware. Despite its advanced capabilities, Google has conducted evaluations to assess the potential misuse of Gemma 3, concluding a low risk level. The company continues to promote Gemma with Google Cloud credits and the Gemma 3 Academic program, which offers academic researchers $10,000 worth of credits to accelerate their research.


#### [Inside Googleâ€™s Investment in the A.I. Start-Up Anthropic](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/technology/google-investment-anthropic.html)

Google has a 14% stake in the AI start-up Anthropic, as revealed by court documents obtained by The New York Times. Despite this significant investment, Google has no control over the company, holding no voting rights, board seats, or observer rights. However, Google is set to invest an additional $750 million in Anthropic in September through a convertible debt, a type of loan that can be converted into equity. This investment is part of Google's broader strategy to maintain its competitive edge in the AI industry, with its total investment in Anthropic exceeding $3 billion.

#### [Sesame, the startup behind the viral virtual assistant Maya, releases its base AI model](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/13/sesame-the-startup-behind-the-viral-virtual-assistant-maya-releases-its-base-ai-model/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/podcast-mic-orange.jpg?resize=1200,638)

AI startup Sesame has made its base model, CSM-1B, publicly available under an Apache 2.0 license. This model, which is the foundation for the company's viral voice assistant Maya, is a 1 billion parameter model that generates "RVQ audio codes" from text and audio inputs. RVQ, or residual vector quantization, is a method of encoding audio into discrete tokens, a technique also used in Google's SoundStream and Meta's Encodec. While the model can produce a variety of voices, it has not been fine-tuned for any specific voice or non-English languages. The company has urged developers not to misuse the model for activities such as voice mimicry without consent, creating misleading content, or engaging in harmful activities. However, it does not have any real safeguards in place to prevent such misuse.
