![](https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22692167/GettyImages_1127480484.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,10.737892056687,100,78.524215886627)

Thirteen current and former employees of OpenAI and Google DeepMind have published a proposal demanding the right to warn the public about the potential dangers of advanced artificial intelligence (AI). The signatories, including AI pioneers Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Stuart Russell, are calling for AI companies to allow them to voice their concerns about the technology without fear of retaliation. They are not seeking to divulge intellectual property or trade secrets, but rather to raise concerns about potential risks. The proposal also calls for the abolition of nondisparagement agreements that prevent insiders from voicing risk-related concerns. The signatories argue that the current whistleblower protections are insufficient as they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks they are concerned about are not yet regulated.
