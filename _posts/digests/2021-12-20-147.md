#### [Announcing the Transactions on Machine Learning Research](https://medium.com/@hugo_larochelle_65309/announcing-the-transactions-on-machine-learning-research-3ea6101c936f)

AI researchers have created a new journal on machine learning research (TMLR) to accelerate AI research and avoid some of the problems with existing research publication processes.
Like other journals, TMLR will accept year-round submissions with no specific deadlines.
Unlike other journals, TMLR will use OpenReview to make the review process public and transparent, will do double blind reviewing (the identity of authors and reviewers are unknown to each other), and will aim for a making fast decisions within 2 months.
The latter is really important, because the 6 months+ reviewing periods for traditional journals is simply too slow for the rate of AI research advances.
TMLR will also evaluate a paper based on the validity and relevance of its claims, not its potential impact, which [is very hard to accurately gauge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09774).
Lastly, the journal has built-in incentives that encourage more reproducibility studies and reward quality reviewers.

**Our take**: The current conference and journal publication models all seem ill-suited for the fast-paced developments in AI, and many AI researchers are unsatisfied with the status quo. While the success of TMLR will take years to tell, it is encouraging to see such experimentations.
