#### [Eight newspaper publishers sue OpenAI over copyright infringement](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/30/eight-newspaper-publishers-sue-openai-over-copyright-infringement.html)

Eight U.S. newspaper publishers, all under the ownership of hedge fund Alden Global Capital, have filed a lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI, alleging copyright infringement. The publishers, which include the New York Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and The Denver Post, among others, claim that OpenAI's language models, GPT-2 and GPT-3, and Microsoft's Copilot assistant have been using their copyrighted articles without permission or payment. The lawsuit also states that Microsoft uses information from their newspapers for the Bing search index, which informs answers in Copilot, but often fails to provide links back to the original articles. This lawsuit follows a similar one filed by The New York Times against OpenAI four months prior, and comes amidst OpenAI's recent partnerships with media companies like Axel Springer and the Financial Times to improve its AI models.


#### [Meta‚Äôs ‚Äòset it and forget it‚Äô AI ad tools are misfiring and blowing through cash](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/28/24141585/meta-ai-advantage-plus-automated-ad-glitch-cpm)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1RYO7_1rB4_WyvhGKdbsl7myEMc=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25417388/247093_Meta_AI_Ads_CVirginia_D.jpg)

Meta's automated ad tool, Advantage Plus, has been overspending on ad budgets and failing to deliver sales, causing frustration among marketers and businesses. The tool, which was pitched as a more efficient alternative to manual ad campaigns, has been unpredictable, with costs per impression (CPMs) inflating significantly. Despite complaints and evidence of the tool's malfunctioning, Meta insists that Advantage Plus is functioning as intended. The company's lack of transparency and accountability has led to uncertainty and dissatisfaction among users, with some businesses completely halting their use of the tool. Despite these issues, Meta's ad revenue for the first quarter amounted to $35.64 billion, a 27% increase from the same period in 2023.

#### [The Unsexy Future of Generative AI Is Enterprise Apps](https://www.wired.com/story/unsexy-future-generative-ai-enterprise-apps/)

Tome, a San Francisco-based startup that creates presentation software powered by generative AI, has shifted its focus towards enterprise customers in an effort to generate meaningful revenue. The company, which was initially funded with $32 million in venture capital and later raised additional funds, had been struggling with revenue generation due to the significant fees paid to companies like OpenAI to power their apps. In response, cofounders Keith Peiris and Henri Liriani laid off 20% of their staff and tripled the charges for premium users. The company now markets itself as "the leading AI-native research and presentation platform for sales and marketing teams," aligning with a trend among AI startups to sell more narrow and premium products to boost revenue. Other startups, like Perplexity and Sierra, have also launched AI-powered enterprise solutions, charging premium rates for their services.


#### [Vibe-Eval: A new open and hard evaluation suite for measuring progress of multimodal language models](https://www.reka.ai/news/vibe-eval)
![](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/66118bc053ae495c0021e80f/t/66333fe704b5316e2b9b198d/1714634731430/?format=1500w)

The article introduces Vibe-Eval, a new evaluation suite designed to measure the progress of multimodal language models. The authors, who are AI experts, have created a set of challenging prompts to test the capabilities of these models, particularly focusing on their inability to perform certain tasks. The evaluation setup is designed to be a more comprehensive alternative to the MMMU multiple choice benchmark, focusing on controlled and consistent experiments. The authors also discuss the challenges of creating hard prompts and the trade-offs between human and model-based automatic evaluation. They propose a lightweight automatic evaluation protocol based on Reka Core, which they found to strongly correlate with human judgement. The authors also share their findings on the difficulty of creating and evaluating hard prompts, and the phenomenon of inverse scaling, where larger models fail tasks that smaller models can complete.
