#### [The Fight to Define When AI Is ‚ÄòHigh Risk‚Äô](https://www.wired.com/story/fight-to-define-when-ai-is-high-risk/)

In April, the European Union proposed the Artificial Intelligence Act, a large initiative to regulate how and which AI products can be used within the EU. 
One of its high profile proposal is to prohibit ‚Äòhigh risk‚Äô applications of AI such as law enforcement use of AI for facial recognition. 
More than 300 organizations have weighed on what ‚Äòhigh risk‚Äô should mean prior to the end of the comment period in August 8. 
For example:

> The European Evangelical Alliance believes all forms of AI with the potential to harm people should be evaluated, and AI with the power to harm the environment should be labeled high risk, as should AI for transhumanism, the alteration of people with tech like computers or machinery. 

More broadly, companies such as Facebook and Google have argued for less regulation, and civil society associations and humans rights associations such as Access Now and The Civil Liberties Union for Europe have fought for more stringent regulation. 
It will take years for this act to be passed and in effect, but much like the U‚Äôs GDPR will be a first-of-its-ind legislation with far reaching effects.k

#### [Only Humans, Not AI Machines, Can Get a U.S. Patent, Judge Rules](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-03/only-humans-not-ai-machines-can-get-a-u-s-patent-judge-rules)

A U.S. federal judge ruled in the case Thaler v. Hirshfeld that "a computer using artificial intelligence can‚Äôt be listed as an inventor on patents because only a human can be an inventor under U.S. law."
This is the clearest position the government has taken yet on whether or not AI can be granted patents and be treated as an inventor under law.
Opponents of this ruling cite that courts in South Africa and Australia have ruled in favor of AI as inventors, and that "this decision would prohibit protection for AI-generated inventions."
It's still possible for AI to be treated as inventors in the U.S. in the future, if Congress makes new laws.
