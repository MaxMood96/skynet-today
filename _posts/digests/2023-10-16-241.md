#### [‚ÄòA.I. Obama‚Äô and Fake Newscasters: How A.I. Audio Is Swarming TikTok](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/12/technology/tiktok-ai-generated-voices-disinformation.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/10/12/business/11tiktok-fakes-B1/03tiktok-fakes-facebookJumbo.jpg)

The use of AI-generated voices is becoming a significant tool in the spread of online misinformation, with platforms like TikTok struggling to manage the surge. Companies such as ElevenLabs have developed tools that allow creators to generate fake audio, enabling them to put their conspiracy theories into the voices of celebrities, politicians, and newscasters. This adds to the existing threats from AI-generated "deepfake" videos, human-like writing from ChatGPT, and images from services like Midjourney. Disinformation watchdogs, including NewsGuard, have noticed an increase in videos containing AI voices, with some accounts pushing baseless claims and receiving hundreds of millions of views. This trend threatens to intensify political disinformation ahead of the 2024 election.


#### [The New AI Panic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/10/technology-exports-ai-programs-regulations-china/675605/)
![](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_NJHyNY1CZsl9Z7d7MZwatZYtIY=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2023/10/china_AI/original.jpg)

The U.S. Department of Commerce's export controls, which limit the sale of certain technologies to foreign countries on national security grounds, are causing tension with China, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The department has restricted China's access to computer chips needed for AI and is considering further controls. This has led to concerns about the impact on AI innovation in the U.S. and the potential for increased friction with China. The department is particularly concerned about "frontier models," advanced AI with wide-ranging uses that could also develop unexpected and dangerous capabilities. A white paper co-authored by a consortium of researchers, including representatives from tech firms like Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, suggests that these models could result in individualized disinformation, novel biochemical weapons, or other unforeseen abuses. The paper proposes a licensing process for frontier AI. However, the potential regulation of frontier models could benefit the four private companies at the center of discussions, potentially restricting the ability of other firms to publish and develop their best AI models. The intertwining of frontier model regulation with national security concerns has led to discussions about how to control these models and keep them out of Beijing's reach. However, the technical feasibility of such controls is uncertain, and any specifications could be easily circumvented.

#### [Adobe is upgrading Photoshop‚Äôs generative AI model ‚Äî and releasing more for Illustrator and Express](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911114/adobe-max-firefly-generative-ai-model-photoshop-illustrator-express)

Adobe has announced three new generative AI models that enhance the capabilities of Illustrator, Adobe Express, and Photoshop. The Firefly Image 2 model, an upgrade from the original Firefly AI image generator, produces higher-quality images with improved resolution, color contrast, and vividness. It also introduces AI-powered editing features and a "Prompt Guidance" feature to assist users in refining their text descriptions. Adobe also introduced the "Generative Match" feature, which allows users to replicate the style of specific images, and a digital "nutrition label" that attaches attribution metadata to AI-generated images. However, this feature is currently in beta and cannot be used for commercial purposes. Adobe also unveiled the Firefly Vector model for Adobe Illustrator, which is the first generative AI model for vector graphics, and the Firefly Design model that generates customizable templates for various applications.
