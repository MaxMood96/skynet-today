#### [White House Releases AI Action Plan to Cement U.S. Leadership](https://natlawreview.com/article/white-house-reveals-ai-action-plan)
![](https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-07/President%20Donald%20Trump%20White%20House%20Website-211799041.jpg.webp?itok=a56S0EFq)

On July 23, 2025, the White House unveiled "Winning the AI Race: America‚Äôs AI Action Plan", a comprehensive strategy to cement U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence (AI). The plan, which follows President Trump's executive order on Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI, outlines over 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: Accelerating Innovation, Building American AI Infrastructure, and Leading in International Diplomacy and Security. The plan aims to foster human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.

Key policies in the AI Action Plan include exporting American AI through partnerships between the Commerce and State Departments and industry, promoting rapid buildout of data centers, enabling innovation and adoption by removing federal regulations that hinder AI development, and upholding free speech in frontier models. The plan emphasizes the importance of AI in transforming the global economy and altering the balance of power in the world. It also underscores the need for the U.S. to lead in innovation, infrastructure, and global partnerships while centering American workers and avoiding Orwellian uses of AI.

#### [OpenAI prepares to launch GPT-5 in August](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257594_NOTEPAD_OPENAI_CVirginia.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

OpenAI is preparing to launch its next-generation model, GPT-5, as early as August, following some delays. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has hinted at the capabilities of GPT-5, describing it as a system that integrates a lot of their technology. The model will include the o3 reasoning capabilities, as part of OpenAI's efforts to simplify and combine its large language models to create a more capable system. The launch of GPT-5 will also include mini and nano versions available through its API. However, it's unlikely that GPT-5 will meet the artificial general intelligence (AGI) threshold, which is linked to OpenAI's profits and would force Microsoft to relinquish its rights to OpenAI revenue and future AI models.

In addition to GPT-5, OpenAI is also preparing to launch an open language model, which is described as similar to o3 mini and will include reasoning capabilities. This model is expected to be released before the end of July, ahead of GPT-5's release. It will be the first time that OpenAI has released an open-weight model since the release of GPT-2 in 2019, and it will be available on Azure, Hugging Face, and other large cloud providers. However, OpenAI's planned release dates often shift due to development challenges, server capacity issues, or rival AI model announcements and leaks.

#### [Big Tech split? Google to sign EU‚Äôs AI guidelines despite Meta snub](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/big-tech-split-google-to-sign-eus-ai-guidelines-despite-meta-snub.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108125067-1743612093512-gettyimages-2189492700-vcg111536239152.jpeg?v=1743612242&w=1920&h=1080)

Google has announced its intention to sign the European Union's guidelines on artificial intelligence (AI), a move that contrasts with Meta's decision to reject the code due to concerns over potential constraints on European AI innovation. Google's decision is driven by the belief that the guidelines will enhance European citizens' access to advanced AI tools as they become available. The company's endorsement of the code comes with the assertion that prompt and widespread deployment of AI could potentially boost Europe's economy by 1.4 trillion euros ($1.62 trillion) annually by 2034.

The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, recently published the final version of its code of practice for general-purpose AI models. The code is not mandatory, and companies are free to decide whether or not to sign it. Google's decision to sign the code is seen as a significant endorsement of the EU's approach to AI regulation, despite Meta's refusal to do the same.

#### [OpenAI launches Study Mode in ChatGPT](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/openai-launches-study-mode-in-chatgpt/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OpenAI-and-ChatGPT.jpeg?resize=1200,676)

OpenAI has launched a new feature called Study Mode in its AI chatbot, ChatGPT, aimed at fostering critical thinking skills in students. Instead of providing direct answers, the tool will pose questions to test users' understanding of the material. The feature is being rolled out to users on Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans, with plans to introduce it to Edu subscribers in the coming weeks. The move is a response to concerns that while ChatGPT can be a useful tutor, it may also negatively impact students' critical thinking abilities. A study released in June found that individuals using ChatGPT for essay writing exhibited lower brain activity compared to those using Google Search or no aid at all.

Despite the launch of Study Mode, there are limitations to its effectiveness. Students can easily switch back to the regular mode if they want direct answers, and currently, there are no tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. OpenAI's VP of Education, Leah Belsky, stated that the company might consider implementing administrative or parental controls in the future. The launch of Study Mode is seen as the first step in improving learning in ChatGPT, and OpenAI plans to publish more information on how students use generative AI in their education.
