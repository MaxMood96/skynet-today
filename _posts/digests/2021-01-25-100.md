    <h5> Researchers develop a traffic light for self-driving cars </h5> 
    <q>
    A pair of new papers from University of Tokyo Institute of Technology researchers and the World Health Organization claim to have addressed one of the great challenges of artificial intelligence: traffic lights. Thanks to machine learning, they can illuminate traffic for much more effective and safer operation than they could on paper.In research authored by Atsushi Sakamoto and colleagues at the Institute of Intelligent Systems and Decision Support in Tokyo, the team presents an efficient way to turn traffic lights on and off. In practice, however, identifying and setting the timing for lighting within a traffic space can prove difficult, as it’s often unpredictable and there may even be visual clues that indicate the start of a car ahead or the end of a short one.Sakamoto and colleagues came up with an efficiency-enabling solution based on approaches developed by researchers at Google, IBM, and Toyota.

    <h5> AI researchers propose making chatbots and voice assistants more like their real-world peers </h5>
    <q> 
    Chatbots, which are a form of virtual personas, have long been the interface between human and machine. Advances in the past few years have democratized voice assistants, responding to the needs of multiple speakers at once, aiming to reduce set times and improve duration. But much of the field has proven difficult to apply conversational AI effectively in the real world, especially on sensitive tasks involving such as sales or customer service.To address this issue, a team from MIT Technology Review (MIT Tech Review) and Beijing-based research institute Beijing Brain Institute have developed a novel approach to training conversational AI systems on a dataset of short conversations over long periods of time. The researchers developed a chatbot named QUEBO after their lab name, which stands for QUEBO, "Quō-" or "QUE-BO." They say the research will serve as a benchmark to benchmark conversational AI’s capability to handle small conveniences like social media conversations in real time.

    <h5> Amazon to Retrain a Third of Its U.S. Workers as Automation Advances </h5>
    <q>
    So far, the American workforce has been largely in workers of color. But Amazon is about to ramp up hiring of some of its more 200,000 hourly workers, according to a person familiar with the company’s plans. The new hires won’t be those in the same field as its more self-professed “white-collar workers,” as the company abbreviates its growing staff. Instead, the roughly 1,000 new workers will be drawn from two large and multiracial groups: Amazon has laid off thousands of Black and Latinx workers, has laid off dozens of Latinx employees, and is currently seeking Federal Employment Development money to pay for new workers.“Right now, the numbers of Black, Latinx, and African American workers are shrinking, because there’s still not enough talent available to continue these high-volume, high-pressure work,” the person familiar with Amazon’s plans explained. Amazon declined to comment on the more than 1,000 new positions it plans to employ.
