Safe Superintelligence (SSI), an AI startup co-founded by Ilya Sutskever, former chief scientist at OpenAI, has successfully raised over $1 billion in funding. Key investors include NFDG, a16z, Sequoia, DST Global, and SV Angel, bringing SSI's valuation to an estimated $5 billion. The funds will be utilized to acquire computing power and expand the team of researchers and engineers based in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv. Sutskever, who previously led the Superalignment team at OpenAI, left the organization following a publicized disagreement with several board members and the CEO, Sam Altman.

#### [OpenAI plans to build its own AI chips on TSMC's forthcoming 1.6 nm A16 process node](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/openai-plans-build-own-ai-120921975.html)
![](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NXvWQcTMBsEdZow62eJUlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pc_gamer_708/51549b8d8c926f2b3ca11c951115a62a)

OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, is reportedly planning to build its own AI chips using TSMC's forthcoming 1.6 nm A16 process node, according to United Daily News. This move is seen as a way to reduce the high costs associated with running ChatGPT on Nvidia's AI servers. The A16 process node, which is still in development, will be the first TSMC node to use backside power delivery, known as Super Power Rail. However, the future of this project is uncertain, with potential investments from Apple and Nvidia, or a possible acquisition by Microsoft, Meta, or Nvidia, which could halt the chip project due to potential loss of sales for Nvidia.

Apple has unveiled its iPhone 16 line, which includes the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max, all designed with the Apple Intelligence AI platform in mind. The new phones feature more powerful chips, a programmable Action button, and a dedicated touch-sensitive camera button. The base models, priced at $799 and $899, have a new 3-nanometer A18 chip, a 2x faster neural engine, and computational photography software for enhanced photo capabilities. The Pro models, priced at $999 and $1,199, have larger displays, a faster A18 Pro chip, and more powerful cameras. All models will support Apple Intelligence, which will be available as a free software update, offering AI-driven writing tools and enhanced search capabilities. However, the delay in the release of Apple Intelligence could impact iPhone sales.

#### [Sign or veto: Whatâ€™s next for Californiaâ€™s AI disaster bill, SB 1047?](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/02/governor-newsom-must-weigh-the-future-of-californias-ai-industry-with-sb-1047/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/newsom-california-capitol.jpg?resize=1200,675)

The controversial California bill SB 1047, aimed at preventing AI disasters, has passed the state's Senate and is now awaiting Governor Gavin Newsom's decision. The bill, introduced by state senator Scott Wiener, targets large AI models that could potentially cause catastrophic events, such as loss of life or cyberattacks costing over $500 million. It proposes making AI developers liable for any harm caused by their models, similar to gun manufacturers being held accountable for mass shootings. The bill also grants California's attorney general the power to sue AI companies for hefty penalties if their technology is used in a catastrophic event. While some industry figures, including Elon Musk, are cautiously optimistic about the bill, others fear it could stifle innovation in California's booming AI industry. Governor Newsom has until September 30 to sign or veto the bill.
