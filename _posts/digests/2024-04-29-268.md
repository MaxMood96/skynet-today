#### [Generative A.I. Arrives in the Gene Editing World of CRISPR](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/technology/generative-ai-gene-editing-crispr.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/11/business/11AI-CRISPR-VIDEO-COVER2/11AI-CRISPR-VIDEO-COVER2-facebookJumbo.jpg)

The article discusses the application of generative A.I. technology in the field of gene editing, specifically in the creation of blueprints for microscopic biological mechanisms that can alter DNA. The technology, developed by a Berkeley-based startup called Profluent, uses methods similar to those of ChatGPT, a popular online chatbot. By analyzing vast amounts of biological data, including existing microscopic mechanisms for DNA editing, Profluent's technology can generate new gene editors. This advancement could potentially accelerate and enhance the precision of disease treatment in the future. The research paper detailing this technology is set to be presented at the upcoming annual meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

Moderna, a leading biotechnology company known for its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, has partnered with OpenAI to implement ChatGPT Enterprise across its operations. This partnership aims to empower every function within the company with AI, fostering the creation of innovative use cases and GPTs that enhance the productivity and impact of each team. Since their collaboration began in 2023, Moderna has been leveraging this technology to accelerate its ambitious goal of developing up to 15 new mRNA medicines within the next five years, including a vaccine against RSV and individualized cancer treatments. This strategy reflects Moderna's commitment to a people-centric, technology-forward approach, continuously exploring new technologies and innovations to boost human capacity and clinical performance.

#### [Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14219v1)


The article introduces phi-3-mini, a compact yet powerful language model with 3.8 billion parameters, trained on 3.3 trillion tokens. Despite its small size, it performs on par with larger models like Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5, achieving 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench, and can be deployed on a phone. The model's success is attributed to its unique training dataset, a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, which includes heavily filtered web data and synthetic data. The model is also designed for robustness, safety, and chat format. The article also mentions two more advanced models, phi-3-small and phi-3-medium, trained for 4.8T tokens, which outperform phi-3-mini on the same benchmarks.

#### [Snowflake Arctic: The Best LLM for Enterprise AI â€” Efficiently Intelligent, Truly Open](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/arctic-open-efficient-foundation-language-models-snowflake/)
![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Snowflake_ARCTIC_4-24_Blog_hero.png)

The Snowflake AI Research Team has introduced Snowflake Arctic, an enterprise-focused Language Learning Model (LLM) designed to provide cost-effective training and openness. Arctic excels in tasks such as SQL generation, coding, and instruction following benchmarks, even when compared to open-source models trained with higher compute budgets. It uses a Dense-MoE Hybrid transformer architecture, combining a 10B dense transformer model with a residual 128Ã—3.66B MoE MLP, resulting in 480B total and 17B active parameters. Arctic is available from Hugging Face, NVIDIA API catalog, and Replicate, and will soon be available on platforms like Snowflake Cortex, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Lamini, Perplexity, and Together. The team is also open-sourcing all of their data recipes and research insights.
