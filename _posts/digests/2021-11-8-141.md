#### [Are We on the Verge of Chatting with Whales?](https://www.hakaimagazine.com/features/are-we-on-the-verge-of-chatting-with-whales/)

Project CETI (Cetacean Translation Initiative), conducted by an interdisciplinary team of biologists and scientists, aims to understand the language of whales, assuming there is one.
Recent studies suggest that other mammals may also possess language in the same sense that humans do, namely, a mode of communication that has semantics (specific words meaning specific things), grammar (widely accepted rules to compose words into sentences), and is learned, not innate (like smiling or yawning).
Sperm whales are known to communicate accoustically over long distances under water with sequences of "click" noises, which makes them especially amenable to analysis.

The key to Project CETI is the statistical language hypothesis, which supposes that the structure and meaning of a language can be extracted from the statistical relationships of its words.
We've seen large language models like GPT-3 seemingly leverage this hypothesis to generate realistic texts after training on large amounts of language data.
Project CETI aims to follow a similar approach by collecting a large dataset of 4 billion sperm whale "words" and trying to train such a language model, which may be able to "generate grammatically correct whale utterances."
If this works, the next step is to translate whale codas into human words, something the researchers hope to do by analyzing the contextual information during speech.

**Our take**: the high-level direction of the project is worth a shot --- even if the method does not find anything interesting, we will have collected a large dataset that can be used for future studies. However, expectations of human-whale communication should be low even if we can generate "sensible" whale sentences, as there is no reason to believe that statistical methods alone can ground the meaning of a totally non-human language.

#### [Facebook, Citing Societal Concerns, Plans to Shut Down Facial Recognition System](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/technology/facebook-facial-recognition.html)

In a surprise announcement, Facebook has stated it will no longer use facial recognition on its service, and will even delete billions of records that were used as part of it. With the feature -- meant to speed up tagging of people in images with facial recognition -- having been in place since 2010, this represents the shuttering of a technology Facebook has heavily invested in and was an industry leader in. Although the feature was only used to power detection of people in images uploaded to Facebook, the amount of data that was behind it still worried privacy advocates, and this move comes after Facebook has long been under scrutiny over how much data it collects and the ways in which it invades peoples’ privacy. Privacy advocates generally lauded this development.

**Our take**: this is a big deal, and a complete surprise. With [Amazon](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-amazon-extends-moratorium-police-use-facial-recognition-software-2021-05-18/), [Microsoft](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/11/microsoft-facial-recognition/) and [IBM](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21284683/ibm-no-longer-general-purpose-facial-recognition-analysis-software) limiting their facial recognition offerings over the past several years as well, there is hope that this technology can progress more slowly until regulation on the topic can be passed.

#### [This Group Pushed More AI in US Security—and Boosted Big Tech](https://www.wired.com/story/group-pushed-ai-us-security-boosted-tech/)

The US's tech giants may fight for market share in the cloud computing industry, but their executives have managed to team up for one thing: to advise the US government on using AI to bolster national security. As part of the National Security Commission on AI (NSCAI), the executives' recommendations--such as steering the Pentagon to work more closely with the tech industry--have already been written into law. Concerns about the group's financial incentives exist, and the companies did not directly respond to WIRED's questioning about whether industry participation in the commission created conflicts of interest. While the group existed for three years and many of its recommendations were written into law, the results lean heavily towards deploying AI with "American values." Ben Winters, a lawyer who works on AI issues at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said the suggestions "failed to recommend comprehensive privacy legislation or any concrete rights by people impacted by harmful AI." Following NSCAI's expiry, Eric Schmidt announced a private organization called the Special Competitive Studies Project that will research the impact of AI and emerging technologies in a range of areas.
