#### [New Anthropic Research Sheds Light on AI's 'Black Box'](https://gizmodo.com/new-anthropic-research-sheds-light-on-ais-black-box-1851491333)
![](https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/66fba5a5f6d10d377e60f0ba143738ea.jpg)

The article discusses a new research paper published by Anthropic, a leading AI company, which aims to demystify the "black box" phenomenon of AI's algorithmic behavior. The paper focuses on understanding why Anthropic's AI chatbot, Claude, prioritizes certain topics over others. The researchers used a process called "dictionary learning" to identify which parts of Claude's neural network corresponded to specific concepts, thereby gaining insight into the model's decision-making process. One notable discovery was a feature associated with the Golden Gate Bridge, which, when activated, indicated that Claude was contemplating the landmark. This research represents a significant step in the field of AI interpretation, which seeks to trace the decision-making path of AI systems to better understand their outputs.

#### [OpenAI removes Sky voice after Scarlett Johansson legal threat](https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/chatgpt/openai-says-sky-voice-in-chatgpt-will-be-paused-after-concerns-it-sounds-too-much-like-scarlett-johansson)

OpenAI has temporarily halted the use of the Sky voice in its ChatGPT application due to its resemblance to actress Scarlett Johansson's voice. The company clarified that the voices in ChatGPT were sourced from paid voice actors, and the similarity between the Sky voice and Johansson's is coincidental. The issue has gained prominence as OpenAI is preparing to introduce a new GPT-4o model into ChatGPT, which will feature a new conversational interface that allows users to engage in real-time conversations with an AI that can mimic natural speech and emotional responses. The new model's multimodality, its ability to understand and generate images, text, video, and speech, sets it apart from previous models and raises concerns about potential misuse, such as creating deepfakes.

#### [Google‚Äôs A.I. Search Errors Cause a Furor Online](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/technology/google-ai-overview-search.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/24/multimedia/24google-gemini-zgmw/24google-gemini-zgmw-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Google's recent unveiling of its new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for search, aimed at competing with Microsoft and OpenAI, has sparked controversy due to a series of errors and untruths. The AI feature, known as AI Overview, has been providing incorrect answers, such as suggesting glue as a pizza ingredient and recommending the consumption of rocks for nutrients. This has led to a significant backlash online, undermining trust in Google's search engine, which is used by over two billion people for reliable information. This incident continues a trend of Google facing issues with its latest AI features immediately after their launch, as seen in February 2023 when its chatbot Bard disseminated incorrect information about outer space, leading to a $100 billion drop in the company's market value.
