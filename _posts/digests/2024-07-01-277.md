#### [OpenAI Introduces CriticGPT: A New Artificial Intelligence AI Model based on GPT-4 to Catch Errors in ChatGPT‚Äôs Code Output](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/06/28/openai-introduces-criticgpt-a-new-artificial-intelligence-ai-model-based-on-gpt-4-to-catch-errors-in-chatgpts-code-output/)
![](https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-28-at-10.11.19-PM.png)

OpenAI has introduced a new AI model, CriticGPT, designed to identify errors in the outputs of ChatGPT, an AI system built on the GPT-4 architecture. CriticGPT, which is trained via Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), aims to address the challenges human reviewers face in consistently assessing the accuracy and quality of complex AI outputs. The model has shown significant effectiveness, with human reviewers using CriticGPT performing 60% better in evaluating ChatGPT's code outputs than those without such assistance. The introduction of CriticGPT represents a major advancement in the field of AI, offering a scalable supervision mechanism that enhances the precision and reliability of AI systems, and facilitating better human-AI collaboration.

#### [Music labels sue AI music generators for copyright infringement](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/music-labels-sue-ai-music-generators-for-copyright-infringement/)
![](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/michael_jackson_waveforms-760x380.jpg)

Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Records have filed lawsuits against AI music-synthesis companies Udio and Suno, accusing them of mass copyright infringement. The AI companies allegedly used copyrighted music to train their AI models, which can generate new songs based on text descriptions. The record labels argue that this could lead to AI-generated music that competes with and devalues the work of human artists. The labels are seeking damages of up to $150,000 per song used in training. This lawsuit could have significant implications for the future of generative AI in creative fields, potentially requiring companies to license all musical training data used in creating music-synthesis models.

#### [Anthropic Debuts Collaboration Tools for Claude AI Assistant](https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2024/anthropic-debuts-collaboration-tools-for-claude-ai-assistant/)
![](https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Anthropic-Claude-AI.jpg)

Anthropic, the creator of the Claude AI assistant, has launched an update to enhance team collaboration and productivity. The update introduces a Projects feature, allowing users to organize their interactions with Claude, including chat activity and knowledge sets, into one place. The Projects feature also enables users to incorporate internal organizational knowledge into Claude's responses by adding documents such as style guides, codebases, and interview transcripts. Additionally, the update includes custom instructions for each Project, a new feature called Artifacts for generating and viewing content, and the ability for Team users to share snapshots of conversations with Claude. Anthropic emphasizes that these new features aim to integrate Claude into existing team processes and assures that any data shared within Projects will not be used to train their generative models without user consent.

#### [Waymo ditches the waitlist and opens up its robotaxis to everyone in San Francisco](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24184814/waymo-waitlist-robotaxi-san-francisco-app-ride)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TDQC3n6eyw2wV-H2-stefxaPTQg=/0x0:5196x3464/1200x628/filters:focal(2598x1732:2599x1733)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25503771/2157160824.jpg)

Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company under Alphabet, has announced that its robotaxi service in San Francisco is now open to the public, eliminating the need for customers to sign up for a waitlist. The move mirrors the company's operations in Phoenix, where the service has been available without a waitlist since 2020. This decision comes as Waymo seeks to solidify its position in the robotaxi industry, despite recent scrutiny following a series of crashes and complaints about obstructions and delays. The company's expansion of its service to all San Francisco residents is seen as a crucial step towards the normalization of autonomous vehicles and a potential path to profitability for the historically money-losing operation.
