#### [Aided by A.I. Language Models, Google’s Robots Are Getting Smart](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/technology/google-robots-ai.html)

Google's robots are becoming smarter with the help of A.I. language models. In a recent demonstration, a one-armed robot successfully picked up a plastic dinosaur when instructed to pick up the "extinct animal." The key advanced that enabled this capability is the application of vision-language models, which is similar to LLMs that power today's chatbots, except it also takes in images, and outputs robot actions directly as numbers, instead of text. This level of object manipulation and logical understanding was previously very difficult for robots. With the integration of A.I. language models, robots are now able to recognize and interact with objects they have never seen before, showcasing advancements in their capabilities. 

#### [An AI Startup Is Helping North American Diesel Trains Clean Up Their Act](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-27/ai-startup-aims-to-help-lower-climate-change-impact-of-train-operators)
![](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iuw9CQZ5Y0jw/v1/1200x806.jpg)

An AI startup, ClearAI, is helping North American diesel trains reduce their emissions. The company developed an AI system that analyzes data from the trains' engines and provides real-time recommendations to optimize fuel consumption and reduce pollution. The system uses machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions, allowing the trains to operate more efficiently and emit fewer pollutants. The key takeaway from the article is that AI technology can play a crucial role in improving the environmental impact of diesel trains by optimizing fuel consumption and reducing emissions.

#### [NYC subway using AI to track fare evasion](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/nyc-subway-using-ai-track-fare-evasion-rcna93045)
![](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2023-07/230720-new-york-fare-evasion-mjf-0929-dfcab5.jpg)

New York City's subway system is using artificial intelligence (AI) surveillance software to identify fare evaders. The system, developed by Spanish company AWAAIT, uses third-party software to detect individuals who are not paying their fares. The software was quietly rolled out in seven subway stations in May, with plans to expand to approximately two dozen more stations by the end of the year. The Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) reported a loss of $690 million to fare evasion in 2022. While the MTA claims the AI system is only used for counting fare evaders and does not flag them to the police, privacy advocates are concerned about the growing surveillance apparatus in New York City. The use of technology to track fare evasion has been criticized for targeting the poor and marginalized communities. The article highlights the increasing surveillance in the city and the potential privacy implications.
