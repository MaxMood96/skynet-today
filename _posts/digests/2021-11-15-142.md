### Top News

#### [Tesla vehicle in ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta mode ‘severely damaged’ after crash in California](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778135/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-crash-fsd-california)

A Tesla car using the company’s beta “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) software has crashed near Los Angeles. 
Luckily no one was injured, but the car was “severely damaged.” 
According to the report written by the Tesla driver and submitted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration:

> The Vehicle was in FSD Beta mode and while taking a left turn the car went into the wrong lane and I was hit by another driver in the lane next to my lane. the car gave an alert 1/2 way through the turn so I tried to turn the wheel to avoid it from going into the wrong lane but the car by itself took control and forced itself into the incorrect lane creating an unsafe maneuver putting everyone involved at risk. 

Tesla has recently allowed drivers to opt in to use the ‘beta’ versions of FSD, something that's not tested enough to roll out for all Tesla owners. 
Some bugs have been found, and beta software updates have been retracted. 
This appears to be the the first crash that has resulted from this beta program, and it is likely to put Tesla under more scrutiny by regulators.

**Our take**: The idea to let non-Tesla employees ‘beta test’ self driving software on public roads is quite strange. Beta testing (“a pre-release of software that is given out to a large group of users to try under real conditions”) is meant to help developers iron out final bugs before release and is a common practice. But unlike using beta versions of software, doing so for cars immediately puts both the drivers and those around them in danger. Should there even be beta testing for autonomous cars by end users? Probably not, or at least not until it's well regulated.

#### [French AI strategy: Tech sector to receive over €2 bln in next 5 years](https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/french-ai-strategy-tech-sector-to-receive-over-e2-bln-in-next-5-years/)

France has begun to lay out its plan for competing in the AI race as well. 
On November 8, government ministers presented the second phase of a national AI strategy. 
More than 2 billion euros (1.5 billion from public funding and 506 million from private) will be poured into French technology in order to produce national and European leaders. 
In addition to focusing funding on "embedded, frugal, and trusted AI," the nation aims to increase its talent pool by training and financing more students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. 
Interestingly, France has also taken a different stance from the EU more broadly on the regulation vs innovation debate: Digital Secretary of State Cédric O lamented the European trend of "regulation before innovation" that could put a severe damper on progress.
While regulation might be important, French leaders see adopting regulation a priori before seeing the abilities and limitations of AI technologies to be a futile endeavor. 
Whatever regulation France may adopt, its leaders would like to leave room for experimentation.

#### [CMU opens first AI maker space to let students 'sharpen the cutting edge of AI'](https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2021/11/10/Carnegie-Mellon-University-JP-Morgan-Chase-AI-maker-space-robots-drone-smart-kitchen-Reid-Simmons-Manuela-Veloso/stories/202111100151)

Carnegie Mellon University has recently opened a maker space dedicated to AI for students to explore and experiment in.
While the notion of a university maker space is common - a large room, usually with equipment for rapid hardware prototyping (e.g. CNC machines and 3D printers), shared among students - this AI maker space is the first of its kind.
The room has a drone net, the Fetch mobile robot, and other types of robots that students can program and with which to test out the latest AI algorithms.

**Our take**: This development is in line with recent trends where AI and robotics development are becoming more affordable and accessible. In a few years time we may see universities "loaning" out such hardware like books in a library, or even see similar AI maker spaces at the high school level.
