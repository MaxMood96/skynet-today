OpenAI has integrated a web search feature into its AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, closing a competitive gap with rivals like Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini. The feature, which can be manually triggered or activated based on queries, allows users to access real-time information from the web during conversations. The search functionality, built with a mix of technologies including Microsoft's Bing, is available across all ChatGPT platforms and is based on a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o. Despite the new feature, OpenAI will continue to update its training data to ensure users have access to the latest advancements. The launch comes amid a surge in AI-powered search technologies, with companies like Meta and Google also developing their own solutions.

San Francisco-based startup, Physical Intelligence, is developing an artificial intelligence model capable of performing a variety of household chores, moving the concept of a domestic robot from science fiction to reality. The company is leveraging large amounts of data to train the AI model, similar to the approach used in creating large language models (LLMs) for chatbots. The goal is to create a general-purpose learning algorithm for the physical world, capable of handling tasks across different types of robots. CEO Karol Hausman likens the process to training language models, emphasizing the generality of their approach and its ability to utilize data from various robotic embodiments.


#### [Decart‚Äôs AI simulates a real-time, playable version of Minecraft](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/31/decarts-ai-simulates-a-real-time-playable-version-of-minecraft/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-31-at-2.28.25PM.png?resize=1200,586)

Decart, an Israeli AI firm, has launched Oasis, an "open-world" AI model that simulates a real-time, playable version of Minecraft. The model, which was trained on Minecraft gameplay videos, generates frames in real time based on keyboard and mouse movements, simulating the game's physics, rules, and graphics. Despite its current low resolution and tendency to forget level layouts, Decart is working on improvements, including the ability to create a custom "world" from an uploaded image. Future versions of Oasis, optimized for Etched's upcoming AI accelerator chips, could potentially generate up to 4K gameplay. However, questions about copyright implications arise as Decart did not mention obtaining Microsoft's permission to train the model on Minecraft footage.
