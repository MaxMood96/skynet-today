#### [Google rolls out Gemini Deep Think AI, a reasoning model that tests multiple ideas in parallel](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/google-rolls-out-gemini-deep-think-ai-a-reasoning-model-that-tests-multiple-ideas-in-parallel/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gemini2.5.jpg?resize=1200,677)

Google DeepMind has introduced Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, its most sophisticated AI reasoning model, designed to answer questions by evaluating multiple ideas at once. This multi-agent model, first revealed in May at Google I/O 2025, utilizes more computational resources than a single agent but generally produces superior answers. A version of this model helped Google secure a gold medal at this year's International Math Olympiad (IMO). Subscribers to Googleâ€™s $250-per-month Ultra plan in the Gemini app will have access to the Gemini 2.5 Deep Think model.

Google asserts that Gemini 2.5 Deep Think surpasses AI models from OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic on LiveCodeBench 6, a rigorous test of competitive coding tasks. The model also achieved state-of-the-art results on Humanityâ€™s Last Exam (HLE), assessing AIâ€™s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions across various subjects. Google plans to share Gemini 2.5 Deep Think with select testers via the Gemini API soon to explore its potential applications in development and enterprise settings. Despite its strong performance, the higher cost of serving multi-agent systems may limit their availability to the most expensive subscription tiers.

#### [OpenAI launches two â€˜openâ€™ AI reasoning models](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/openai-launches-two-open-ai-reasoning-models/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-2021258442.jpg?resize=1200,800)

OpenAI has released two open-weight AI reasoning models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, available for free download on the Hugging Face platform. The larger model, gpt-oss-120b, can operate on a single Nvidia GPU, while the smaller gpt-oss-20b model is compatible with consumer laptops with 16GB of memory. These models can send complex queries to AI models in the cloud, enabling developers to connect them to more advanced closed models if necessary. This release marks OpenAI's first 'open' language model since GPT-2, launched over five years ago.

The models were trained using processes similar to OpenAI's proprietary models, employing a mixture-of-experts (MoE) approach to utilize fewer parameters for any given question, enhancing efficiency. They also underwent high-compute reinforcement learning (RL), a post-training process to teach AI models right from wrong in simulated environments. However, OpenAI will not release the training data used to create its open models due to ongoing lawsuits regarding the use of copyrighted works in AI model training. The models are released under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing enterprises to monetize them without needing to pay or obtain permission from OpenAI.

#### [Anthropic Releases Claude Opus 4.1 With Agentic, Coding and Reasoning Upgrades](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/anthropic-releases-claude-opus-4-1-with-agentic-coding-and-reasoning-upgrades/)
![](https://analyticsindiamag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Generative-AI-darling-silicon-valley.jpg)

Anthropic has unveiled Claude Opus 4.1, an enhanced version of its flagship AI model, featuring improvements in coding, reasoning, and agentic task performance. Building on the previous Claude Opus 4, this update is available to paid users via Claude Code, API access, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloudâ€™s Vertex AI. The company claims Opus 4.1 delivers top-tier coding performance, scoring 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark for real-world software engineering tasks. The update also boosts capabilities in in-depth research, data analysis, and agentic search.

According to GitHub, the model shows improvements in most areas compared to Opus 4, particularly in multi-file code refactoring. Rakuten Group has also highlighted Claude Opus 4.1â€™s ability to identify precise corrections in large codebases. Despite these significant upgrades, the pricing for the AI model remains unchanged. This release underscores Anthropic's commitment to advancing AI capabilities in coding and reasoning tasks.

Google DeepMind has introduced Genie 3, an advanced AI world model capable of generating interactive 3D environments in real time. Unlike its predecessor, Genie 2, which allowed only up to a minute of interaction, Genie 3 supports a few minutes of continuous interaction. The new model also remembers the placement of objects in the virtual world for about a minute, ensuring consistency in the environment. Genie 3 can generate worlds at a resolution of 720p and run at 24fps, and it introduces "promptable world events" that allow users to modify aspects of the world, such as weather conditions or character additions, using prompts.

However, Genie 3 is not yet widely accessible. It is being launched as a limited research preview for a select group of academics and creators to help the developers understand potential risks and develop appropriate mitigation strategies. The model also has certain limitations, such as restricted user interaction with the generated worlds and the generation of legible text only when provided in the input world description. Google is exploring ways to make Genie 3 available to additional testers in the future.
