OpenAI, a leading artificial intelligence (AI) lab, has announced a $6.5 billion all-stock deal to acquire IO, a start-up founded by Jony Ive, a former top Apple executive known for designing the iPhone. The announcement was made by Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, who stated that the acquisition aims to create "a new family of products" for the era of artificial general intelligence (AGI), a future technology that is expected to achieve human-level intelligence. This move is seen as an attempt to transition AI from being primarily an app-based technology to being integrated into everyday physical devices.

The deal is significant as it brings together two major figures in the tech industry and could potentially reshape the way AI is used and perceived. Despite the advancements in AI technology, it has largely remained confined to apps on phones. This acquisition could pave the way for AI to become more physically present in our daily lives, moving beyond the realm of software and into the world of tangible, everyday gadgets.

Google has unveiled its latest video-generating AI model, Veo 3, at the Google I/O 2025 developer conference. The model is capable of creating sound effects, background noises, and dialogue to accompany the videos it generates, marking a significant improvement in quality over its predecessor, Veo 2. Veo 3 is available in Googleâ€™s Gemini chatbot app for subscribers to Googleâ€™s $249.99-per-month AI Ultra plan. The model can be prompted with text or an image to generate videos. Veo 3's ability to understand raw pixels from its videos and sync generated sounds with clips automatically sets it apart from other models in the increasingly saturated video generator market.

Veo 3's development was likely facilitated by DeepMind's earlier work in "video-to-audio" AI, which involved training a model on a combination of sounds, dialogue transcripts, and video clips. While the source of the content used to train Veo 3 has not been disclosed, it is speculated that YouTube, owned by Google, may have been used. To counter the risk of deepfakes, DeepMind is using its proprietary watermarking technology, SynthID, to embed invisible markers into frames generated by Veo 3. Google also announced new capabilities for Veo 2, including a feature that allows users to provide the model with images for better consistency, understand camera movements, and add or erase objects from videos. These new features will be available on Google's Vertex AI API platform in the coming weeks.
