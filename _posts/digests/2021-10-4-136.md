#### [Amazon’s Astro Is a Mobile Alexa and Cup Holder that Costs $1k ](https://spectrum.ieee.org/amazon-astro-robot)
Ever wanted a cheap robot that will do your chores and take care of everyday tasks around the home? 
That's exactly what you're not getting with Amazon's new household robot, Astro. 
Many seem to agree that the behemoth's PR video about the robot fails to answer why it's needed in the first place: it seems to be a $1000 contraption that lets you be closer to Alexa's voice. 
While Amazon says Astro is "a big step forward," it is important to keep our expectations in check about such creations. 
At the same time, it's possible that Astro did make some incredible leaps: IEEE Spectrum acknowledges that doing simultaneous localization and mapping in a real home environment is very challenging, but it is also possible that Amazon is using hand-picked clips to make Astro seem more capable than it is.

#### [DeepMind’s AI predicts almost exactly when and where it’s going to rain](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/29/1036331/deepminds-ai-predicts-almost-exactly-when-and-where-its-going-to-rain/)

Researchers at Deepmind and several other institutions published the paper Skilful precipitation nowcasting using deep generative models of radar in the Nature journal. 
“Nowcasting” is defined as the high-resolution forecasting of precipitation up to two hours ahead, and the paper shows that the new approach “ranked first for its accuracy and usefulness in 89% of cases against two competitive methods”, with the rankings provided by 56 weather forecasters. 
As with Deepmind’s prior breakthrough with the protein-folding model AlphaFold, this is another demonstration of the company making substantial progress on long-established problems and achieving results that are sure to have major implications.

#### [Are AI ethics teams doomed to be a facade? The women who pioneered them weigh in](https://venturebeat.com/2021/09/30/are-ai-ethics-teams-doomed-to-be-a-facade-the-women-who-pioneered-them-weigh-in/)

AI ethics has become a hot topic in recent years due to the wide deployment of AI-based solutions.
Examples of AI harm are real and immediate in fields like facial recognition, hiring decisions, and credit card approvals.
However, it's not clear what is the best way to tackle and improve AI ethics.
So far, large companies like Google and Facebook have built their internal ethics teams, but their works have all been stifled when pitted against the companies' immediate commercial interests.
For Google it was large language models, and for Facebook it was misinformation.
Experts cite the lack of leadership buy-in, from both the technical and legal sides, as causes for these ineffective ethics efforts.
Moving forward however, many argue that such confrontational views of AI ethics is misleading.
The goal of AI ethics is to prevent harm to a company's customers and users, and society at large, and this is aligned, not against, a company's long-term business interests.
