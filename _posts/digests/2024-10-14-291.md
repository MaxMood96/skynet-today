John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking work in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in the development of artificial neural networks. These networks, which mimic the human brain's learning process, have become integral to scientific research, including physics, where they are used to design new materials, analyze large data sets from particle accelerators, and assist in universe surveys. The Nobel committee highlighted the transformative impact of Hopfield and Hinton's work, stating that their machine learning breakthroughs have provided a new way to use computers to address societal challenges. The committee also noted that artificial neural networks are now commonplace in internet services such as Google's search engine, Apple's Siri, and OpenAI's ChatGPT, despite these services being rooted in mathematics and computer science rather than physics.

The 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper of Google DeepMind, and David Baker of the University of Washington, for their groundbreaking work in predicting and creating proteins using advanced technology, including artificial intelligence (AI). Hassabis and Jumper utilized AI to predict the structure of millions of proteins, while Baker employed computer software to invent a new protein. Their work, which has been described as "truly huge" by Johan Aqvist, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, has revolutionized the understanding of proteins, a task that previously took months or even decades. Now, with AI models like AlphaFold, this can be achieved in mere hours or minutes.

#### [Anthropic CEO goes full techno-optimist in 15,000-word paean to AI](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/11/anthropic-ceo-goes-full-techno-optimist-in-15000-word-paean-to-ai/)

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has published a lengthy essay outlining his optimistic vision for the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Amodei predicts that "powerful AI", capable of outperforming Nobel Prize winners in fields such as biology and engineering, will emerge by 2026. He believes this AI will be able to control any software or hardware, perform most jobs currently done by humans, and even design its own tools. Amodei also suggests that AI could revolutionize medicine, potentially treating nearly all infectious diseases, eliminating most cancers, curing genetic disorders, and halting Alzheimer's at the earliest stages within the next 7 to 12 years. He also claims that AI could solve world hunger, combat climate change, and transform economies in developing countries. However, Amodei acknowledges the potential dangers of AI to civil society and the need for discussions about economic organization in a post-AI world. Critics argue that his predictions are overly optimistic and ignore the potential negative impacts of AI, such as environmental damage and increased inequality.

![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iazccN8I0U7iQYvNMKlpAS7JUzw=/0x0:2250x1495/1200x628/filters:focal(316x426:317x427)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25676425/Adobe_Video_AI_Model.png)

Adobe has launched its AI video model, Firefly, which includes several new tools for video generation and editing. The first tool, Generative Extend, available in Premiere Pro, allows users to extend footage by two seconds, making it useful for minor adjustments and corrections. Two other tools, Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video, are being launched as a limited public beta in the Firefly web app. These tools allow users to generate video from text prompts and still images, respectively, with a maximum clip length of five seconds. Despite some limitations, Adobe claims its AI video model is commercially safe and can embed Content Credentials to disclose AI usage and ownership rights when published online.

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, has unveiled a new electric vehicle, the Cybercab, designed specifically for autonomous driving. The vehicle, which lacks a steering wheel or pedals, charges inductively and is expected to be 10-20 times safer than human-driven vehicles. Musk anticipates that the Cybercab will enter production by 2026 or 2027, with plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year. Despite the futuristic design and ambitious plans, Tesla's approach to autonomous vehicles has been questioned by experts, particularly in relation to the company's aggressive push for Level 2 advanced driver-assist systems. The company is also facing competition from other companies like Waymo and Cruise, which have already conducted extensive on-road testing with their driverless vehicles.
