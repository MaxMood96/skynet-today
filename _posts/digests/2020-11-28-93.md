### Mini Briefs

#### [Designed to Deceive: Do These People Look Real to You?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/21/science/artificial-intelligence-fake-people-faces.html) 
We've all heard of "don't believe everything you see online." With advancing deepfake technologies, the threshold for what's real and fake is growing ever more grey. This improvement is primarily accelerated by GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) where there is a generative network that spits out fake images and a discriminative network, which attempts to detect fake images in a sort of zero sum game. Companies like NVIDIA have outsourced GANs capable of generating convincing portraiture known as StyleGan2. These development raises questions about the proliferation of disinformation on social media and the risk in which fake profiles can lead to the integrity of our online society. 

#### [Building a Benchmark for Human-Level Concept Learning and Reasoning](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/building-a-benchmark-for-human-level-concept-learning-and-reasoning/) 
Due to variations in design definitions and objectives of AI systems, defining objectives and standardizing goals has proved invaluable for progress in the field. Notable examples include the ImageNet competition which facilitated rapid improvements in computer vision algorithms such as AlexNet. The goals of the proposed NVIDIA benchmark is to highlight the differences between human visual recognition and computerized pattern recognition. The introduced Bongard-LOGO challenge highlights notable gaps between current state of the art visual recognition methods and human performance on this benchmark. Researchers hope to encourage neuro-symbolic methods that utilize interalized rules in conjunction with neuroscience inspired learning methods like deep learning. 

#### [Big pharma is using AI and machine learning in drug discovery and development to save lives](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-machine-learning-in-drug-discovery-development-2020?utm_source=contentstudio.io&utm_medium=referral) 

Pharmaceutical companies have been slow in adopting digital health technologies. Yet, large pharmaceutical companies have invested tremendously in AI technologies at every stage from drug discovery to clinical trials. AI can reduce drug discovery costs by up to 70% by analyzing existing literature and modeling potential drugs interact with the human body. Furthermore, AI can make trials more efficient, reducing recurrent costs and imnprove participant monitoring. While not quite ready for primetime, AI can help mitigate future pandemics by making drug discovery more efficient and empower new healthcare technologies.
