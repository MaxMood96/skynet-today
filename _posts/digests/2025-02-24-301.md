Elon Musk's Grok-3 has emerged as a significant player in the AI race, topping the Chatbot Arena leaderboard and the App Store, surpassing ChatGPT. Musk's xAI team has managed to deploy this leading foundational model in record time, with plans to introduce ChatGPT-like voice interaction and desktop apps soon. The team is also working on building an AI gaming studio. Despite Grok-3's success, OpenAI's ChatGPT still leads with 400 million weekly active users, a 33% increase from December. The competition now lies in whether OpenAI can maintain its product lead before Grok and other competitors catch up. Meanwhile, there have been significant job changes in the tech world, including Mira Murati's announcement of her OpenAI rival, Thinking Machines Lab, and Yonghui Wu's move to ByteDance to run AI research.

Anthropic has launched a new AI model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which is designed to "think" about questions for as long as users want. This hybrid AI reasoning model can provide both real-time answers and more considered responses, with users able to activate the model's reasoning abilities. The model is part of Anthropic's efforts to simplify the user experience around its AI products, and will be available to all users and developers, with premium Claude chatbot plan users having access to the model's reasoning features. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is more expensive than other models, but it is also a hybrid model, unlike others. The model is designed to improve the accuracy of final answers by breaking problems down into smaller steps, a process modeled after deduction.
