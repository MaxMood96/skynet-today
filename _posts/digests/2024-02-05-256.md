The Allen Institute for AI (AI2) has launched OLMo 7B, a fully open, state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) that includes pre-training data and training code. The OLMo framework is designed to assist researchers in training and experimenting with LLMs, and is available for direct download on Hugging Face and GitHub. The framework includes full pretraining data, training code and model weights, and an evaluation suite. By making OLMo and its training data fully accessible to the public, AI2 aims to foster collaborative development of the best open language model in the world. The OLMo framework is expected to increase precision in AI research, reduce carbon emissions associated with AI development, and provide lasting results by keeping models and their datasets open.


#### [HK firm scammed of $34 million after employee duped by video call with deepfake of CFO](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/hk-firm-scammed-of-34-million-after-employee-is-duped-by-video-call-with-deepfake-of-cfo)

A multinational company in Hong Kong was defrauded of HK$200 million ($34 million) after an employee was deceived by a deepfake video conference call featuring the company's CFO and other staff members. The scammers used publicly available footage to digitally recreate each individual, convincing the employee to transfer the large sum across five bank accounts in 15 transactions. The employee, who works in the finance department, only realized the deception a week after the initial contact. The Hong Kong police are investigating the case, which is the first of its kind in the region, but no arrests have been made so far.


#### [FCC moves to criminalize most AI-generated robocalls](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/fcc-moves-criminalize-ai-generated-robocalls-rcna136347)
![](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-01/240130-Jessica-Rosenworcel-robocalls-se-116p-5f4af3.jpg)

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is planning to criminalize unsolicited robocalls that use artificial intelligence (AI) generated voices, following a recent incident where a fake message mimicking President Joe Biden's voice was used to discourage voting in New Hampshire's primary election. The proposed change, which is expected to pass in the coming weeks, would outlaw such robocalls under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), a law that regulates automated political and marketing calls made without the receivers' consent. The FCC has previously used the TCPA to impose hefty fines on illegal robocall activities. This move will empower state attorneys general to take legal action against spammers who use AI, and is welcomed by organizations like AARP, who warn that AI can be used to enhance scams targeting vulnerable groups like seniors.


#### [Inside the Music Industry’s High-Stakes A.I. Experiments](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/02/05/inside-the-music-industrys-high-stakes-ai-experiments)
![](https://media.newyorker.com/photos/65b404bb35cf775ef8ebc117/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/240205_r43719web-story.jpg)

Sir Lucian Grainge, the chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group (UMG), has been instrumental in the company's dominance over other major labels like Warner Music and Sony. With over 45 years of experience in the music industry, Grainge has overseen the growth of UMG, which now boasts more than half of Spotify's twenty most streamed artists of all time. Despite the drastic changes in the music industry, including the shift from physical distribution to digital streaming, Grainge has managed to keep UMG profitable. However, the advent of AI in music production, which can create novel images, text, and music, presents a new challenge. Grainge is keen on exploring this technology, but is also wary of its potential to erode the value of UMG's copyrights.
