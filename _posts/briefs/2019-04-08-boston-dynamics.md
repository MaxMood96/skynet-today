## What Happened

In March of 2019, Boston Dynamics released yet another amazing video
showcasing the box stacking capabilities of their whegged (wheel-legged)
robot. The robot zooms around a warehouse, picking up and placing
objects on its two wheels.

As Wired put it, this represents Boston Dynamics being ‚Äúback at it‚Äù,
with ‚Äòit‚Äô referring to their periodic release of videos showcasing their
robots‚Äô performing amazing feats. The previous such video came out in
October 2018 and showcased the parkour skills of their humanoid robot
Atlas. The robot can be seen soaring over logs and leaping onto
platforms ‚Äì actions which require extreme energy and strength for a
hefty robot to perform (Atlas weighs up to 150kg). Nevertheless, the
video shows Atlas navigating these terrains with remarkable ease:

Marc Raibert, former Carnegie Mellon and MIT professor and director of
the Leg Lab, developed the first self-balancing hopping robots. In 1992,
he went on to found Boston Dynamics. Since then, you may have heard of
them through many of their [other projects](https://www.bostondynamics.com/robots). Some favorites
include [BigDog](https://www.bostondynamics.com/bigdog), capable of
traversing rough terrains;
[SandFlea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6b4ZZQkcNEo), which stores
enough energy to jump onto buildings;
[SpotMini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHBcVlqpvZ8), which brings
smooth moves to the dance floor; and
[Atlas](https://www.bostondynamics.com/atlas), the humanoid robot that
can [drive its own vehicle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLEFq6vjLhs).

In particular, Atlas has demonstrated many impressive actions throughout
the years. Its capabilities include [backflips, opening and holding
doors, washing dishes, trail running, and lifting
boxes](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/10/11/17964912/boston-dynamics-atlas-parkour-video-jumping),

</figure>

## The Reactions

Atlas initially triggered a dystopian response from viewers and media
alike. Many of these headlines appear to be in jest. However, there also
seems to be serious concern from some viewers about the true
implications of Atlas‚Äô current capabilities, and some of the following
don‚Äôt help:

-   Fast Company greeted the new warehouse robot with the headline
    ‚Äú[Those frightening Boston Dynamics robots will also take your warehouse job](https://www.fastcompany.com/90327001/those-frightening-boston-dynamics-robots-will-also-take-your-warehouse-job)‚Äù.

-   The Telegraph published [a summary](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/10/12/boston-dynamics-shows-terrifying-humanoid-robot-can-run-leap/) of Atlas‚Äô backflip video calling the robot a ‚Äúterrifying humanoid.‚Äù

-   At the time of the reveal of the original Handle robot, The Inquierer called it a [new robot nightmare](https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3005516/boston-dynamics-has-a-new-robotic-nightmare-called-handle).

Many of the ‚Äúhumorous‚Äù headlines referenced the pop-culture concept of a ‚Äúrobot uprising.‚Äù

-   Gizmodo [warned](https://gizmodo.com/latest-boston-dynamics-video-proves-the-robot-uprising-1829691337) of a ‚Äúshockingly nimble‚Äù robot uprising.

-   MarketWatch [advised readers](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/boston-dynamics-atlas-robot-can-now-do-parkour-so-dont-bother-running-away-2018-10-11) to ‚Äúnot bother running away.‚Äù

-   Mashable [has a top 5](https://mashable.com/2018/05/14/boston-dynamics-robot-round-up/?europe=true) of ‚Äútimes Boston Dynamics robots scared the hell out of us‚Äù.

This, in turn, has led to some concerns about misunderstandings that may arise from Boston Dynamics' strategy of releasing these videos without much further explanation: 

-   Researchers and other experts are more worried about people‚Äôs raised
    expectations about what robots really can do than by the
    robots themselves. [NVIDIA‚Äôs director of research describes](https://twitter.com/AnimaAnandkumar/status/1089017420877049857)
    her experiences with the general public, stating that many believe
    the Boston Dynamics dogs are more intelligent than real dogs.
    
<figure>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In my broad audience talk, I usually ask which one is more intelligent: a dog or a <a href="https://twitter.com/BostonDynamics?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BostonDynamics</a> robot.

General public has a flawed understanding of intelligence and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AI</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mediahype?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mediahype</a> is not helping</p>&mdash; Anima Anandkumar (@AnimaAnandkumar) <a href="https://twitter.com/AnimaAnandkumar/status/1089017420877049857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2019</a></blockquote>
</figure>

-   Filip Piekniewski, an AI researcher, likewise expressed that the videos do not mean that Boston Dynamics' robots are anywhere near as intelligent as dogs: 
    
<figure>

</figure>

-   Jack clark, a journalist, stated that Boston Dynamics‚Äô press
    strategy was simply to release videos and avoid any questions from
    the press: 
   
<figure>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Former journalist here - Boston Dynamics main press strategy for many years was to publish videos and never give interviews or respond to technical questions, so they never tried to help media add more info/context. : (</p>&mdash; Jack Clark (@jackclarkSF) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackclarkSF/status/1051507550305144832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2018</a></blockquote>
</figure>
   
It's hard to get a sense for the general public's perception of the videos, but just sampling several tweets shows some are genuinly concerned about the 'robot apocalypse' scenario:

<figure>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Are we all so blind that we can‚Äôt see that Boston Dynamics is the real world Skynet that is creating robots and dogs that will destroy all humans and then drink tea in our couches?

Of course, these represent outliers in the public opinion. Still, reactions along the lines of 'impressive, but also vaguelly offputting' are common whenever new Boston Dynamics videos come out:

Believing that these videos represent robotics with advanced autonomous capability 
is problematic, since that is far from the truth. There are
substantial differences between a robot that autonomously performs these
actions versus one that is preprogrammed to do so with the help of
external sensors and computation, and the lack of transparency makes it
unclear what Atlas and friends are capable of. Though the details are not clear,
it appears to be the case that Boston Dynamics' technology does not involve learning or advanced cognition
and is based on human-defined methods for robotic control:

</figure>

Fortunately, multiple articles have tackled the subject of Boston Dynamics videos.
[A Wired article](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/boston-dynamics-robotics-roboticist-how-to-watch)
does a good job explaining how to watch and interpret Boston Dynamic‚Äôs: focus on
the large margins of error (there‚Äôs always a chance in the demos that
things can go wrong, but what you‚Äôre seeing is the successful trial),
partial autonomy (the systems don‚Äôt operate entirely on their own and
require human guidance or pre-determined instructions), and our human
instinct to anthropomorphize and connect to biological systems (humans
tend to see the dog- and human-looking robots and assume many advanced
capabilities that the biological versions already have, such as
perception and emotion). Additional articles tackling the subject include [Boston Dynamics‚Äô scary robot videos: Are they for real?](https://phys.org/news/2018-06-boston-dynamics-scary-robot-videos.html), [Why Boston Dynamics' backflipping borg shouldn't scare you](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/17/boston_dynamics_backflipping_robot/), [You‚Äôre Expecting Too Much Out of Boston Dynamics‚Äô Robots](https://www.wired.com/story/boston-dynamics-spotmini-running-man/), and [The Fantasy Robots Of Boston Dynamics](https://digboston.com/the-fantasy-robots-of-boston-dynamics/). As the last piece states:

> "The achievements of Boston Dynamics in robot movement on two and four legs are undeniable and sometimes breathtaking. That‚Äôs where its real contribution lies. But its videos play on widespread, potentially dangerous fantasies of autonomous robotic armies without human casualties (on our side, that is), old people left in the care of machines, and a near future when robots do all the work. It‚Äôs high time we freed ourselves from the techno-marketing hype and began to see AI and robotics for the fascinating, although limited, developments they really are."

## Our Perspective

Alongside their video, Boston Dynamics released a caption with their
video, stating:

> Handle is a mobile manipulation robot designed for logistics. Handle autonomously performs mixed SKU pallet building and depalletizing after initialization and localizing against the pallets. The on-board vision system on Handle tracks the marked pallets for navigation and finds individual boxes for grasping and placing.

> When Handle places a boxes onto a pallet, it uses force control to nestle each box up against its neighbors.  The boxes used in the video weigh about 5 Kg (11 lbs), but the robot is designed to handle boxes up to (15 Kg) (33 lb).  This version of Handle works with pallets that are 1.2 m deep and 1.7 m tall (48 inches deep and 68 inches tall).

While it‚Äôs nice to see this description being released alongside their
video, it would be helpful if Boston Dynamics would reveal more about
their methods. The [about](https://www.bostondynamics.com/about) page of their website 
does not contain more details, and their [robot-specific](https://www.bostondynamics.com/handle) pages 
explain slightly more but do little to dispell misunderstanding. The lack of concrete details is in part responsible for
the rampant speculation online, and in fact the company seems to provoke
and enjoy the speculation by posting viral, vague videos. This helps to
create interest around Boston Dynamics‚Äô projects, and their incentives
to be as opaque as possible are almost understandable: secrecy insures
that competitors cannot copy their achievements, strikes the public‚Äôs
imagination, and leaves everyone in the dark about the weaknesses of
their technology. Yet the dearth of information is not all benefits: it
creates unrealistic expectations for real world performance of the
robots, and provokes the ire of less naive observers. 

[An article](https://futurism.com/dark-future-autonomous-guard-dogs-black-mirror)
on the potential dark future of AI spells out the parallels of SpotMini
from Boston Dynamics to a Black Mirror episode containing weaponized
guard dogs that look a little too similar for comfort and more
importantly goes into detail about what exactly people fear. The list
includes aspects such as the incomprehensible, black-box decision-making
process of robots, particularly when it comes to significant decisions
that may infringe upon international human rights law and international
policing standards. While Boston Dynamics does not explicitly make any
egregious claims on how advanced their technology is (unlike
[Sophia](https://www.skynettoday.com/briefs/sophia)), their
non-transparency does not help assuage these fears.

These threads and discussions prompt some of the same questions that we
came up with while watching the videos:

* Are the actions and motions pre-programmed? Does the sequence of the
obstacles impact performance?

* Are Atlas‚Äôs decision-making process and motion planning occurring in
real-time?

* Is the computation being done on-board? How much information is
embedded within the visual markers?

* How much information does Atlas have about its environment? What
knowledge is transferable to other environments?

Many of these questions represent open challenges in robotics and
autonomy; some transparency would be helpful to better gauge which
problems Boston Dynamics has solved. In addition, there is a gap between
systems that can perform a few of these individual tasks in structured
environments and those that can autonomously navigate in unstructured
terrain. To be fair, what Boston Dynamics has accomplished is still very
impressive. Their robots are capable of many extremely dynamic tasks and
appear to be incredibly robust to disturbances in their environment.
However, transparency would help both researchers and general public
alike to better understand which features are realistic and which are
fantasy.

In addition, there is genuine concern from the general public and
researchers alike about the use of robots as autonomous war weapons.
Boston Dynamics [makes no secret](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/boston-dynamics-1.4693731)
of their interest for military applications, and the misguided headlines
about a ‚Äúrobot uprising‚Äù against humans obfuscate the more mundane
prospect of humans killing other humans with more ease than ever, using
robots.


## TLDR

Atlas is a fantastic case study
of a robot that demonstrates the significance of distinguishing between
one-off demonstrations and generalizable techniques that are usable in
various contexts. The physics and mechanics of each capability are
incredibly impressive, but we are very far from the cries of a robot
uprising. For comparison, trickshot specialists produce jaw-dropping
highlight reels, but their skills don‚Äôt always translate directly to the
level of professional athletes who must seamlessly weave multiple skills
together simultaneously. Real-world environments are very complex, and
systems need to be robust to uncertainty in their environments.
