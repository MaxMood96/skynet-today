#### [Europe approves landmark AI legislation, challenging tech giants’ power](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/14/eu-parliament-approves-ai-act/)
![](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D3DHTX5CWEVTA7QAL3DWDNX5AQ.jpg&w=1440)

The European Parliament has approved the EU AI Act, a comprehensive package of regulations aimed at protecting consumers from potentially harmful applications of artificial intelligence (AI). The legislation takes a risk-based approach, introducing restrictions on AI applications based on their potential danger. It would ban unacceptable tools, such as systems allowing law enforcement to predict criminal behavior, and introduce new limits on high-risk technologies, such as recommendation algorithms and AI-generated content. The legislation also requires companies to publish summaries of copyrighted data used to train their AI tools. The EU's aggressive posture towards tech giants puts it on a collision course with American companies, with OpenAI warning that it may be forced to pull out of Europe.

**Key Takeaway:**
The EU AI Act is a landmark legislation that aims to protect consumers from the potential dangers of AI. By taking a risk-based approach, the legislation introduces restrictions on AI applications based on their potential harm. This puts the EU on a collision course with American tech giants, who have been funneling billions of dollars into AI. OpenAI has warned that it may be forced to pull out of Europe if the legislation is too restrictive. The EU's aggressive posture towards tech giants puts it in a position of global leadership on tech regulation, as other governments, including the US Congress, are just beginning to grapple with the threat presented by AI. The EU's regulations are likely to influence policymakers around the world and set standards that could trickle down to all consumers.

#### [Paul McCartney says AI tools helped rescue John Lennon vocals for ‘last Beatles record’](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759296/the-beatles-now-and-then-restoration-ai-paul-mccartney-john-lennon)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6fDZNk7yLhBjw61B9m7SdSY5zo=/0x0:4347x3143/1200x628/filters:focal(2174x1572:2175x1573)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24724155/1406691716.jpg)

Paul McCartney discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to rescue John Lennon's vocals for what will be the last Beatles record. McCartney mentions that AI was used in the film Get Back to separate John's voice from a cassette recording. For the upcoming record, they were able to use AI to get John's voice pure and mix the record as usual.

**Our Take:**
The use of AI tools to rescue and enhance John Lennon's vocals for the last Beatles record raises interesting questions about the intersection of technology and art. While it is impressive that AI can separate and enhance specific elements of a recording, it also raises concerns about the authenticity and integrity of the final product. Can AI truly capture the essence of an artist's voice and intention? Will future generations be able to distinguish between genuine recordings and those manipulated by AI? As technology continues to advance, artists and listeners alike will need to grapple with these ethical and artistic considerations.

#### [Meta announces Voicebox, a generative model for multiple voice synthesis tasks](https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-announces-voicebox-a-generative-model-for-multiple-voice-synthesis-tasks/)
![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cfr0z3n_a_robot_speaks_into_a_microphone_67f9bdd0-06de-49c1-9e51-0eb05f82f74f.png?w=1200&strip=all)

Meta Platforms' AI research arm has unveiled Voicebox, a generative model that can generate speech from text. What sets Voicebox apart is its ability to perform tasks such as editing, noise removal, and style transfer, even without being specifically trained for them. The model has been trained on a general task of mapping voice audio samples to their transcripts and can synthesize speech in six languages. It uses Meta's "Flow Matching" technique, which allows it to learn from varied speech data without manual labeling. Voicebox has potential applications in speech customization, voice sampling, and synthetic data generation for training speech processing models.

**Our Take:**
Voicebox is an impressive generative model that showcases the potential of AI in speech synthesis. Its ability to perform tasks beyond its training is a significant advancement, enabling applications such as speech customization and voice sampling. However, the ethical concerns raised by Meta about the misuse of AI-generated content are valid. As AI technology becomes more powerful, there is a need for responsible development and deployment to prevent malicious use. Striking a balance between innovation and safeguarding against potential harm is crucial. The development of classifier models to detect speech and audio generated by Voicebox is a step in the right direction, but ongoing efforts to address limitations and mitigate risks are necessary.
