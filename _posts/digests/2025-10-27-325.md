#### [Google and Anthropic announce cloud deal worth tens of billions of dollars](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/anthropic-google-cloud-deal-tpu.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107244923-1684788591875-gettyimages-1251294457-PGONCHAR_7364.jpeg?v=1761251795&w=1920&h=1080)

Google and Anthropic unveiled a multiyear cloud agreement that will give Anthropic access to up to 1 million of Google’s TPUs, including seventh‑gen “Ironwood” accelerators, beginning in 2026. Valued in the tens of billions of dollars, the deal is expected to bring well over 1 GW of AI compute online—roughly matching industry estimates that a 1‑GW data center costs ~$50B with ~$35B for chips. Anthropic plans to deploy TPUs where Google’s price‑performance and efficiency lead, within a multi‑cloud strategy that also leverages Nvidia GPUs and AWS Trainium for training, inference, and research. Both companies emphasized sustained TPU price‑performance gains, with Google Cloud’s Thomas Kurian pointing to multi‑year results and Anthropic CFO Krishna Rao calling the expansion essential for scaling frontier models.

Rapid business growth at Anthropic underpins this compute ramp: revenue is nearing a $7B run rate, Claude is used by 300,000+ businesses (up ~300× in two years), and the number of large customers (> $100k run rate) has grown sevenfold. Claude Code reached a $500M annualized run rate within two months—described as Anthropic’s fastest‑growing product. While Google increased its equity stake to $3B (including a new $1B tranche), AWS remains Anthropic’s primary cloud, investing $8B and hosting “Project Rainier” on Trainium 2 to lower cost per compute. Analysts estimate Anthropic added 1–2 points to AWS growth recently, potentially >5 points in H2 2025. A vendor‑neutral architecture also kept Claude running during a recent AWS outage and preserves control over model weights, pricing, and customer data.

![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/chatgptatlas.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered macOS web browser available globally now, with Windows, iOS, and Android “coming soon.” Atlas offers a persistent split‑screen companion that pairs webpages with a live ChatGPT transcript, one‑click summaries, and “cursor chat” for in‑line edits in emails or documents. Another key feature is memory, which stores user preferences and context (with controls to view/manage or go incognito). An agent mode can take actions such as booking flights or reservations and editing documents; it’s restricted to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users. Built by veterans from Chrome and Firefox, Atlas extends OpenAI’s agentic experiments like Operator and ChatGPT Agent to make chat the default browsing paradigm.

Just two days later, Microsoft rolled out a similar Copilot Mode in Edge, branding it an “AI browser” that can see and reason over tabs, summarize and compare information, and execute “Actions” like filling forms or booking hotels, plus “Journeys” to map connections across tabs. The experience closely mirrors Atlas but uses a ride‑along panel in a new tab rather than split‑screen. Opera’s Neon takes a more complex route with three AI modes—Chat (page‑aware chatbot), Do (agentic controller for tasks), and Make (a sandbox for mini web tools)—and “Cards” as prewritten prompt power‑ups, all for $19.90/month. Reviews noted Neon’s Chat can be verbose and struggles with dynamic page elements, while Do sometimes mis‑executes tasks and lacks mid‑task correction; Make works but can produce clunky tools. Collectively, these launches converge on tab‑aware assistants, summarization, and action‑taking agents—but diverge on memory handling, agent reliability, UI choices (split‑screen vs ride‑along), pricing, and platform support.

#### [Microsoft’s Mico is a ‘Clippy’ for the AI era](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/microsofts-mico-is-a-clippy-for-the-ai-era/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mico-1.png?resize=1200,675)

Microsoft debuted Mico, a customizable animated avatar for Copilot that acts as a “face” for the AI—reminiscent of Clippy but with voice‑driven interactivity. Mico listens, reacts visually, changes colors, and can store long‑term conversational memories; tapping it repeatedly triggers an Easter egg that morphs Mico into Clippy. The avatar is enabled by default in voice mode, can be disabled, and is initially rolling out in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. New modes include Learn Live (U.S.‑only) for step‑by‑step tutoring, plus upgrades for health queries and deep research.

Copilot is also gaining a “Real Talk” mode that mirrors users’ conversational style while maintaining its own perspective, promising to push back rather than act sycophantically. The fall Copilot update adds multi‑person chats, long‑term memory, connectors for email and cloud storage, and deeper Microsoft Edge integrations. Edge is being positioned as an AI browser that can see your tabs, summarize and compare content, and take actions such as booking hotels or filling out forms—aimed at competing with ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity’s Comet, Dia, and Chrome with Gemini. Microsoft casts these changes as consumer‑friendly and trust‑focused, though it remains to be seen whether Mico’s floating blob wins users over and avoids the pitfalls of chatbot “psychosis.”

[DeepSeek Just Released a 3B OCR Model: A 3B VLM Designed for High-Performance OCR and Structured Document Conversion](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/10/20/deepseek-just-released-a-3b-ocr-model-a-3b-vlm-designed-for-high-performance-ocr-and-structured-document-conversion/). The system compresses page images into a small set of vision tokens via a high‑resolution DeepEncoder and decodes them with a 3B Mixture‑of‑Experts language decoder to achieve near‑lossless OCR at roughly 10× compression, offering explicit token‑budget modes (Tiny–Large and Gundam) and competitive benchmark and throughput results.

[The Coverage Principle: How Pre-Training Enables Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15020). This paper argues that pre‑training provides broad probabilistic coverage over functions and data distributions, which in turn makes subsequent task‑specific post‑training more efficient and effective.

[LLMs Can Get "Brain Rot"!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13928). Researchers report that prolonged training on low‑quality web text degrades LLMs’ reasoning, context handling, safety behaviors, and personality, though instruction tuning and retraining on cleaner data can partially restore performance.

[How Do LLMs Use Their Depth?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18871). Findings suggest models make high‑frequency “guesses” in early layers that are refined into context‑appropriate tokens in deeper layers; easier predictions (e.g., punctuation, function words) resolve earlier, while harder or multi‑token decisions require more depth.

[Continual Learning via Sparse Memory Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15103). By updating only a small TF‑IDF–ranked subset of memory slots per step, sparse memory finetuning enables models to acquire new facts and document knowledge without the catastrophic forgetting seen in full or LoRA finetuning.

[Accelerating Vision Transformers with Adaptive Patch Sizes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18091). The method adaptively increases patch sizes in low‑entropy image regions using multi‑scale entropy estimates and a zero‑initialized MLP, reducing token count and cutting ViT training and inference cost by up to ~40% while maintaining accuracy.

[Antislop: A Comprehensive Framework for Identifying and Eliminating Repetitive Patterns in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15061). A sampler, automated pipeline, and token‑preference optimization work together to detect and reduce repetitive phraseology in LLM outputs while preserving model performance.

[Every Step Evolves: Scaling Reinforcement Learning for Trillion-Scale Thinking Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18855). A combination of training components—IcePop, C3PO++, and ASystem—enables reinforcement‑learning‑based scaling to a trillion parameters, delivering state‑of‑the‑art benchmark performance while remaining open source.

[Seed3D 1.0: From Images to High-Fidelity Simulation-Ready 3D Assets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19944). The approach generates high‑quality, simulation‑ready 3D assets with detailed geometry, photorealistic 4K textures, PBR materials, and physics‑engine compatibility, and composes coherent scenes to scale data for robotic simulation and training.
