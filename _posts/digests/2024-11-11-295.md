![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_molecular_biology_408e5075-81f3-4f82-bad4-8c5228f22230-1.webp?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all)

Google DeepMind has released the source code and model weights of AlphaFold 3 for academic use, a move that could significantly speed up scientific discovery and drug development. AlphaFold 3 is a major upgrade from its predecessor, capable of modeling complex interactions between proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules, which are crucial for understanding drug discovery and disease treatment. The system's diffusion-based approach aligns with the basic physics of molecular interactions, making it more efficient and reliable. Despite some limitations, such as producing incorrect structures in disordered regions and only predicting static structures, the release of AlphaFold 3 is seen as a significant step forward in AI-powered science, with potential impacts extending beyond drug discovery and molecular biology.

OpenAI's upcoming model, code-named Orion, may not represent a significant advancement over its predecessors, as per a report in The Information. The model's performance surpasses existing OpenAI models, but the rate of improvement appears to be decelerating, with Orion potentially not outperforming previous models in certain areas like coding. To address this, OpenAI has established a foundations team to explore ways to enhance its models despite a decreasing availability of new training data. Some of the strategies being considered include training Orion on synthetic data generated by AI models and refining models during the post-training process. OpenAI has not confirmed plans to release Orion this year.

Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 election has significant implications for the future of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States. Trump's stance on AI has varied, but he has consistently viewed the technology as a competitive tool against China. His administration is expected to repeal President Biden's Executive Order on AI, which aimed to address potential threats to civil rights, privacy, and national security. Trump's AI policy may also involve rolling back regulations to accelerate infrastructure development and maintaining chip export restrictions to curb China's access to advanced semiconductors. However, the Trump administration's approach to AI is marked by internal divisions, with some allies advocating for looser regulations and others emphasizing the potential risks of AI. The direction of Trump's AI policy remains uncertain, with the potential to significantly impact national security, the economy, and the global balance of power.
