### Top News

#### [Anthropic’s Claude improves on ChatGPT but still suffers from limitations](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/09/anthropics-claude-improves-on-chatgpt-but-still-suffers-from-limitations/?guccounter=1)

Summary: You've obviously heard of ChatGPT. Now, meet Claude. Anthropic, the AI alignment startup founded by ex-OpenAI employees, has developed a ChatGPT-like system that appears to improve upon OpenAI's. Using a technique called "constitutional AI," Anthropic's researchers had a model write responses to a variety of prompts, then revise those responses according to a set of "constitutional" principles. The model is available in closed beta, and after a media embargo lifted researchers have posted their interactions with the system on Twitter, observing improvements in robustness and creativity. But, of course, Claude is not without its own limitations: for example, asking the system questions in base 64 bypasses its built-in filters for harmful content. Users report it is worse at math than ChatGPT, and doesn't solve the problem of writing factually wrong statements.

Our Take: As of this writing, OpenAI has moved to monetize ChatGPT. Unless things change drastically, I do not expect Anthropic to do anything of the sort. I think a more interesting point, though, follows from the impact of OpenAI's earlier InstructGPT, the first GPT model offered through OpenAI's API that was trained using Reinforcement Learning form Human Feedback (RLHF), the same training scheme that has made ChatGPT so nice to work with. RLHF was, to our knowledge, the first product of AI alignment research that made its way into a product that had significant usage. ChatGPT is important for similar reasons, while Claude represents further work by alignment researchers that may end up in systems used by many. This may portend an even greater role for AI alignment in mainstream ML research going forward.

#### [Conservatives Are Panicking About AI Bias, Think ChatGPT Has Gone 'Woke'](https://www.vice.com/en/article/93a4qe/conservatives-panicking-about-ai-bias-years-too-late-think-chatgpt-has-gone-woke)

Summary: How should automated systems like ChatGPT handle complex issues of truth and fairness, and is there bias embedded within them? Following a recent article published in the National Review, concerns have been rising from right-wing commentators over AI “going woke”. Yet these criticisms ignore the overwhelming history of AI’s biased impacts: which have largely targeted the marginalized groups that these newer systems aim to protect. A rush to write off ChatGPT and other technologies as “left-wing” may distract from more pressing conversations regarding the safety and equity of AI, such as the racial discrepancies in facial recognition systems. Political considerations will always be present in determining which inputs and outputs these systems have access to. As new algorithms begin to move in a more progressive direction, are they “adding bias” or merely working against the biases that have existed since their creation?

Our Take: The article makes a crucial point that has been forgotten in recent discussions on AI ethics: those who fear AI gaining a left-leaning bias cannot ignore the widespread history of other biases that these technologies have proliferated. If past algorithms hadn’t displayed as much potential to target marginalized groups, we wouldn’t be needing to wire stricter guidelines into the systems to prevent them from following that tendency. Even today, the impact of something like ChatGPT is far from uniform: left-leaning biases may sometimes be present, but discriminatory ones remain.
While many people are selective in which biases they draw attention to, these conversations don’t have to be fully unproductive. I checked out some of the comments on the post that started this debate, and found many issues where consensus may be closer than it seems. For example, some people fear that integrating AI into the justice system would “criminalize conservative opinions”. Yet those on the other side have also raised concerns of legal AI perpetuating mass incarceration and discrimination. Rather than disparaging AI ethics as “woke propaganda”, the path forward will come through offering concrete solutions on how to ensure the fairness of all AI systems: acknowledging the past to move into the future.

#### [Deepfake challenges 'will only grow'](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/01/230117133710.htm)

Summary: Recent advancements in deepfake technology have sparked concern among AI experts and foreign policy analysts from Northwestern University and the Brookings Institute, who have released a report outlining the growing challenges posed by deepfakes in the near future. With the advent of newer generative AI methods such as stable diffusion, the ease of developing deepfakes has significantly increased, making them a potential threat for targeted military and intelligence operations. The report, released last week, calls for a collaborative effort to address the issue, including the development of a code of conduct for government use of deepfakes, as well as increased public awareness and the development of detection methods.

Our Take: Deepfakes have been a cause for concern for some time now, and with the advancements in AI technology, their quality and ease of production have become even more sophisticated. The report released by Northwestern University and the Brookings Institute highlights the need for a shared responsibility in addressing this issue. As citizens, it is important to exercise caution and think twice before generating and sharing deepfakes. Additionally, government and policy groups must establish regulations and guidelines surrounding the technology. From our perspective, it is crucial to develop effective methods for detecting and combating deepfakes, utilizing the wealth of data available from AI-synthesized sources. However, it is also important to anticipate and prepare for more advanced and creative deepfake generation methods in the future. Overall, addressing the challenges posed by deepfakes requires a comprehensive and collaborative effort across various sectors.
