OpenAI has launched Codex, a highly capable AI coding agent that uses the company's codex-1 model, optimized for software engineering tasks. Codex operates in a cloud-based virtual computer and can interact with GitHub to preload user code repositories. It can write simple features, fix bugs, answer questions about a codebase, and run tests in one to 30 minutes. The tool is available to ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team subscribers, with plans to expand access to ChatGPT Plus and Edu users. OpenAI aims for Codex to act as a "virtual teammate," autonomously completing tasks that would take human engineers significant time. Despite potential limitations and error-proneness, the launch of Codex signifies OpenAI's entry into the rapidly growing AI coding tools market.

OpenAI, the parent company of AI service ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan following a power struggle and widespread scrutiny. CEO Sam Altman has confirmed that OpenAI will remain under the control of its non-profit board, while transitioning into a public benefit corporation. This move will allow the non-profit to maintain control over OpenAI, receiving a significant stake in the business arm, thus providing it with funds for its own objectives. The new structure will also enable the organization to abandon its current complex governance structure, which has limited its profits and hindered its ability to raise funds. Altman believes that this change will align with the company's mission of extending access to AI, which will drive societal and quality of life improvements.

DeepMind, Google's AI R&D lab, has developed a new AI system named AlphaEvolve, designed to tackle problems with machine-gradable solutions. The system uses models to generate, critique, and evaluate a pool of possible answers to a question, thereby reducing the tendency of AI models to 'hallucinate' or make things up. AlphaEvolve uses state-of-the-art Gemini models, making it more capable than previous AI systems. However, it has limitations, such as only being able to solve problems it can self-evaluate and only describing solutions as algorithms, making it unsuitable for non-numerical problems. Despite these limitations, DeepMind claims that AlphaEvolve has been successful in rediscovering the best-known answers to a set of math problems 75% of the time and finding improved solutions in 20% of cases.
