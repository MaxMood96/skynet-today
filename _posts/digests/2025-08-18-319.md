OpenAI rolled out GPT-5 to all ChatGPT users with multiple variants and aggressive pricing, pitching it as smarter, faster, and less prone to hallucinations than prior models‚Äîthough Sam Altman stopped short of calling it AGI. The lineup spans GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, an API-only GPT-5-nano, and premium tiers GPT-5-pro and GPT-5-thinking that allocate more compute for tougher queries. API pricing lands at $1.25/1M input tokens and $10/1M output for GPT-5, $0.25/$2 for 5-mini, and $0.05/$0.40 for 5-nano‚Äîundercutting Anthropic Opus 4.1 and beating Google‚Äôs cheapest tiers at high volumes, potentially sparking a price war. ChatGPT is adding Gmail/Contacts/Calendar integrations (Pro first), preset personalities (Cynic/Robot/Listener/Nerd), and planned Advanced Voice Mode; Plus and Pro get higher limits, with Pro offering unlimited GPT-5 and access to GPT-5-pro and -thinking.

The launch stumbled at first. OpenAI removed legacy models and introduced an auto-router that invisibly picked models; a sev broke the autoswitcher on day one, making GPT-5 appear ‚Äúway dumber,‚Äù prompting Altman‚Äôs apology, doubled rate limits, and restoration of GPT-4o and others. The model picker has returned with Auto/Fast/Thinking modes and optional legacy models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3), recognizing that routing alone isn‚Äôt satisfying user preferences and workflows. Early technical impressions: GPT-5-thinking and GPT-5-pro meaningfully cut hallucinations and strengthen writing and long-form reasoning versus o3/o3-pro, while base GPT-5 (fast) feels closer to GPT-4o with a different tone and reduced sycophancy; coding performance is strong, and latency is improving via caching. The debut drew flak for a ‚Äúchart crime,‚Äù a broken first demo, and sudden deprecations‚ÄîOpenAI now pledges clearer disclosure of which model answered and more notice before removing popular models.

#### [Companies Are Pouring Billions Into A.I. It Has Yet to Pay Off.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/13/business/ai-business-payoff-lags.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/12/business/00biz-ai-lag/00biz-ai-lag-facebookJumbo.jpg)

A new ‚Äúproductivity paradox‚Äù is emerging around generative AI: despite widespread adoption, measurable business gains remain elusive. McKinsey finds nearly 80% of companies say they use generative AI, yet roughly the same share report no significant bottom-line impact. Firms are investing heavily in tools like ChatGPT to automate customer support and back-office workflows, but practical snags‚Äîincluding hallucinations, uneven accuracy, integration hurdles, and governance risks‚Äîare slowing returns, echoing the early PC era when big tech spend didn‚Äôt immediately boost productivity.

On the ground, reliability issues (hallucinations and non-deterministic outputs), data quality and access constraints, and the challenge of wiring LLMs into legacy systems keep many deployments stuck in pilots or narrow use cases. Time savings often don‚Äôt scale into financial outcomes, while costs‚Äîcompute, licensing, data labeling, security, and compliance‚Äîcan offset efficiency gains. In short, capability is moving faster than organizations can reengineer workflows, risk controls, and metrics to capture sustained value.

#### [Anthropic takes aim at OpenAI, offers Claude to ‚Äòall three branches of government‚Äô for $1](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/anthropic-takes-aim-at-openai-offers-claude-to-all-three-branches-of-government-for-1/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2159671948.jpg?resize=1200,800)

Anthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government to all three branches of the U.S. government for $1 per agency for one year, escalating OpenAI‚Äôs earlier $1 offer limited to the executive branch. Claude for Government supports FedRAMP High for sensitive but unclassified workloads, and Anthropic highlighted deployments via AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir to slot into existing secure infrastructures. The company will provide technical support to help agencies integrate AI into workflows and cited active use cases at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the DC Department of Health. While multiple labs also have up to $200 million in DoD funding to leverage AI for national security, Anthropic is clearly pushing for broader civilian adoption.

A differentiator Anthropic emphasized is multicloud access and data control versus OpenAI‚Äôs current FedRAMP High availability tied to Azure Government Cloud‚Äîimportant for agencies prioritizing data sovereignty and flexibility. The move follows Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind joining the GSA‚Äôs approved AI vendor list; Google‚Äôs response is pending. Framed as accessible yet secure, the $1 offer is time-limited to one year, signaling a competitive land-grab across legislative, judicial, and executive domains.

#### [Goodbye, $165,000 Tech Jobs. Student Coders Seek Work at Chipotle.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/technology/coding-ai-jobs-students.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/28/multimedia/AI-jobs-Mishra-01-cjwl/AI-jobs-Mishra-01-cjwl-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg)

A decade-long push to ‚Äúlearn to code‚Äù swelled computer science majors, with U.S. undergrad CS enrollments topping 170,000 in 2023‚Äîmore than double 2014 levels, per the Computing Research Association. Once-lucrative entry roles with six-figure starting salaries and rich stock grants have become scarce amid layoffs at Amazon, Intel, Meta, and Microsoft and a broader Big Tech hiring pullback. New grads report few interviews and are seeking non-tech roles, illustrated by viral posts like a CS graduate who says their only interview was with Chipotle.

One major factor: rapid adoption of AI programming tools that can generate large volumes of code, reducing demand for junior developers focused on routine implementation. Companies are concentrating on fewer, more senior roles while leaning on code generation and automated testing to boost productivity, compressing junior hiring pipelines. The clash between booming CS enrollment and shrinking entry-level openings is leaving many graduates stranded despite solid training‚Äîmarking a sharp reset from the era of abundant $100,000+ offers and perks.
