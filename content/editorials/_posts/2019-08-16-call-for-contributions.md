Skynet Today is looking for contributors who are interested in writing a brief or editorial on the following proposed topics.
A brief is a short article covering a recent news story, while an editorial is a longer article that covers a broader scope.

If you're interested in diving deep into any of these prompts, feel free to reach out to us at [editorials@skynettoday.com](mailto:editorials@skynettoday.com)!

# Briefs
1. **Deep Fakes** - While the increasing realism of neural-network generated images, videos, and audio have legitimately productive use cases (e.g. [computer-aided art creation](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/ai-playground/)), their more alarming applications in creating real-looking fake videos and pictures are [worrisome to many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake#Criticisms). Write a brief to explain what deep fakes are, their applications and media reception, and summarize what experts say about their impacts in the immediate future.
2. **AI Business and Startups** - With DeepMind losing more than [half a billion dollars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-07/alphabet-s-deepmind-takes-on-billion-dollar-debt-as-loss-spirals) the past year and many "AI-powered" startups actually [using humans to power their applications](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/14/20805676/engineer-ai-artificial-intelligence-startup-app-development-outsourcing-humans), it may be natural to question the value and role AI plays in AI businesses and startups. Write a brief that reviews recent news related to this area and comment on what expectations are realistic for new startups in the AI space.
3. **AI and the Military** - AI is considered to be a "dual-use" technology, where the same underlying techniques can be applied to both civilian and military ends. Some are concerned about an [AI arms race in the defense industry](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/05/whoever-predicts-the-future-correctly-will-win-the-ai-arms-race-russia-china-united-states-artificial-intelligence-defense/), while others are worried about [autonomous killing machines being deployed without human supervision](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/03/us-military-changing-killing-machine-robo-tank-program-after-controversy/155256/). Write a brief that explains the current state of military AI applications including beyond just robotics, what about them is genuinely of concern, and what is actually just hype and fearmongering.

# Editorials
1. **AI in Media and the Public** - The American public both [expects and is afraid of big AI advancements in the next decade](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/9/18174081/fhi-govai-ai-safety-american-public-worried-ai-catastrophe). This is in no small part due to exaggerated media coverage that is often [disconnected from reality](https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/ai-narratives/AI-narratives-workshop-findings.pdf). Write an editorial that examines the relationship between media coverage and public perception of AI and explain what about AI is perceived correctly, and what is not.
2. **The Meaning of "AI"** - Recent years have seen countless headlines containing the word "AI" while their contents actually refer to relatively trivial ML or statistic techniques. Many such coverage seem to imply that AI is a single, magical entity that just keeps on amassing capabilities. This is misleading, and the view that ["AI is whatever that hasn't been done"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect#"The_AI_effect"_tries_to_redefine_AI_to_mean:_AI_is_anything_that_has_not_been_done_yet) isn't exactly helpful either. Write an editorial to review the usage of the word "AI" in recent media and propose guidelines on when and how "AI" should be used to alleviate inaccurate perception of AI.
3. **Understanding AI Exponentialism** - [Amara's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Amara#Amara's_law) states that "we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run." There are many such [misconceptions about evaluating the growth of AI capabilities in the short and long term](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609048/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-ai-predictions/), which is problematic for constructing realistic expectations for future AI. Write an editorial to discuss the case (or the lack thereof) for exponential growth in AI development and comment on helpful ways of thinking about the speed of AI development in the near future.
