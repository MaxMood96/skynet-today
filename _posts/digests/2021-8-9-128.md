### Top News

#### [A new generation of AI-powered robots is taking over warehouses](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/06/1030802/ai-robots-take-over-warehouses/)

A growing number of companies are working to commercialize advances in robotic perception and planning for the task of warehouse automation. Unlike already deployed robots which typically perform the same motions over and over and don't take context into account, these companies' robots have the intelligence to adaptively manipulate a wide variety of objects. These kinds of skills are useful for automating tasks such as pick-and-place, which involves moving a objects between different containers. While it will take time to retrofit existing factories and warehouses to make use of this technology, it appears likely that this adoption is only a matter of time.

> For now, somewhere around 2,000 AI-powered robots have been deployed, with a typical warehouse housing one or two...But the industry has reached a new inflection point, and \[it's predicted\] that each warehouse will soon house upwards of 10 robots, growing the total to tens of thousands within the next few years.

#### [The slow collapse of Amazon's drone delivery dream](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-drone-delivery-prime-air)

The UK Amazon drone delivery team has laid off more than 100 employees as it scaled back operations over the last two years.
Interviews with former employees reveal a chaotic and dysfunctional working environment, from changing product requirements to the constant churn of workers and managers.
While Amazon opened the UK team in 2016 with a PR blitz, promising drone deliveries in months, the company's technical approach made the endeavor that much harder.
In particular, unlike drones from other companies that drop packages meters off the ground, Amazon opted to land the drone outside customer's houses.
Doing so safely and robustly in a wide variety of conditions proved a difficult challenge for AI-powered drones.
As the CEO of the drone company Matternet puts it, "promises of mass market e-commerce drone delivery \[...\] are far from reality."

#### [This New Way to Train AI Could Curb Online Harassment](https://www.wired.com/story/new-way-train-ai-curb-online-harassment/)

Online harassment is a scourge that has persisted since the early days of the internet. In recent years, researchers have used machine learning to identify content that constitutes misogyny and other forms of harassment. But training those machine learning algorithms requires labeled data, and deciding whether an online post constitutes harassment is a tricky issue. Rather than using part-time contractors who are paid pennies per post, a group of Danish researchers has hired a group of 8 people full-time. The benefit is that this group, with their differing identities and political opinions, might be able to help determine what counts as harassment more accurately than other labeling methods would.
