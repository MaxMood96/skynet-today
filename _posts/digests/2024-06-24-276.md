#### [Anthropic has a fast new AI model â€” and a clever new way to interact with chatbots](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24181961/anthropic-claude-35-sonnet-model-ai-launch)

Anthropic has launched its latest AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which it claims can match or surpass the performance of OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o or Googleâ€™s Gemini across a broad range of tasks. The new model, which is available to Claude users on the web and iOS, and to developers, is said to be twice as fast as its predecessor and outperforms the previous top model, 3 Opus. Claude 3.5 Sonnet excelled in benchmark tests, outscoring GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Metaâ€™s Llama 3 400B in most categories. Alongside the new model, Anthropic is introducing a feature called Artifacts, which allows users to interact with the results of their Claude requests, enhancing the model's utility beyond a simple chatbot.

AI search startup Perplexity, backed by Jeff Bezos and other tech giants, is facing backlash from publishers like The New York Times, The Guardian, CondÃ© Nast, and Forbes for allegedly circumventing blocks to access and repurpose their content, potentially costing publishers billions in ad revenue. Perplexity, valued at $1 billion, plans to serve ads later this year and offers a $20 monthly subscription. Unlike other AI models like OpenAI and Google Overview, Perplexity does not seem to acknowledge publishers' attempts to block its crawlers. Publishers are demanding commercial licenses for the use of their intellectual property and reimbursement for ad revenue earned by Perplexity from displaying copies of their content. The publishing industry is expected to lose over $10 billion due to such practices, according to Ameet Shah, partner and SVP of publisher operations and strategy at Prohaska Consulting.
