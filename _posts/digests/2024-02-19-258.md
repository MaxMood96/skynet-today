OpenAI has unveiled Sora, a new video-generation model that can create realistic scenes from text instructions. The model is capable of generating complex scenes with multiple characters, specific types of motion, and accurate details of the subject and background. It can also generate a video based on a still image, fill in missing frames on an existing video, or extend it. Despite some limitations in simulating the physics of complex scenes, the model has shown impressive results. Currently, Sora is only available to a select group of testers and visual artists for feedback and risk assessment. This development marks a significant advancement in the field of AI, with video generation improving at a remarkable pace.


#### [Gemini 1.5 is Google’s next-gen AI model — and it’s already almost ready](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073457/google-gemini-1-5-ai-model-llm)

Google has announced the launch of Gemini 1.5, the successor to its large language model, Gemini. The new model, which is available to developers and enterprise users, boasts significant improvements over its predecessor, including a general-purpose model that matches the performance of the high-end Gemini Ultra and outperforms Gemini 1.0 Pro on 87% of benchmark tests. Gemini 1.5 utilizes a technique known as "Mixture of Experts" (MoE), which allows it to process only a part of the model for each query, enhancing speed and efficiency. A key feature of Gemini 1.5 is its expanded context window, capable of handling 1 million tokens, significantly more than OpenAI's GPT-4 and the current Gemini Pro. This allows the AI to process larger queries and more information simultaneously, which Google CEO Sundar Pichai believes will be particularly beneficial for businesses.
