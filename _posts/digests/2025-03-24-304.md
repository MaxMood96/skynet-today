#### [OpenAI Unveils New Audio Models to Make AI Agents Sound More Human Than Ever](https://www.maginative.com/article/openai-unveils-new-audio-models-to-make-ai-agents-sound-more-human-than-ever/)
![](https://www.maginative.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/03/GPT-4o-transcribe.jpg)

OpenAI has introduced a suite of new audio models aimed at making AI voice agents sound more human-like and responsive. The release includes two new speech-to-text models, GPT-4o-transcribe and GPT-4o-mini-transcribe, which outperform previous models in transcription accuracy across multiple languages, even in challenging scenarios such as understanding different accents and filtering background noise. The new GPT-4o-mini-tts text-to-speech model allows developers to control the tone and delivery of the AI's speech, a feature OpenAI refers to as "steerability". Additionally, an updated Agents SDK simplifies the conversion of text agents into voice agents. These advancements, which are available to developers through OpenAI's API, could potentially revolutionize human-computer interaction by making it more natural and intuitive.


#### [Baidu launches two new versions of its AI model Ernie](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/16/baidu-launches-two-new-versions-of-its-ai-model-ernie/)

Chinese tech giant Baidu has introduced two new versions of its artificial intelligence model, Ernie - Ernie 4.5 and Ernie X1. The company claims that Ernie X1 performs at the same level as DeepSeek R1 but at half the cost, while Ernie 4.5 has been enhanced to understand memes and satire due to its "high EQ". Both models possess multimodal capabilities, meaning they can process video, images, audio, and text. Despite being an early competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT, Baidu has faced challenges in achieving widespread adoption. The company plans to launch Ernie 5 later this year, promising further multimodal enhancements.


#### [Anthropic adds web search to its Claude chatbot](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/anthropic-adds-web-search-to-its-claude-chatbot/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Anthropic-Dario-Amodei.jpeg?w=1182)

Anthropic's AI chatbot, Claude, has been upgraded with a web search feature, allowing it to scour the internet for information to inform its responses. The feature is currently available for paid users in the U.S., with plans to extend it to free users and other countries. The web search function works with the latest model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and provides direct citations for fact-checking. However, the feature has been inconsistent in triggering for current events-related questions. This update brings Claude in line with other AI chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Mistral's Le Chat, despite previous claims that Claude was designed to be self-contained. There are concerns about the risk of Claude providing incorrect information or mis-citing sources, a problem that has been observed in other chatbots.


#### [Meta AI is finally coming to the EU, but with limitations](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/20/meta-ai-is-finally-coming-to-the-eu-but-with-limitations/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2195497483.jpg?resize=1200,800)

Meta has announced the launch of its AI-powered virtual assistant, Meta AI, in the European Union, despite ongoing regulatory issues with European privacy authorities. The tool, which has been available in the U.S. since 2023, will be rolled out across Meta's social platforms, including WhatsApp in the U.K., but with a more limited feature set due to EU's stringent privacy regulations. Meta AI, capable of chatting, answering questions, and generating images, has not been trained on local users' data in the EU, hence it won't be notifying users or seeking their consent. The launch represents Meta's first step in bringing more AI to Europe, despite the company's criticism of Europe's AI regulations.
