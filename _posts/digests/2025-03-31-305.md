#### [Judge Allows ‚ÄòNew York Times‚Äô Copyright Case Against OpenAI to Go Forward](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5288157/new-york-times-openai-copyright-case-goes-forward)

A federal judge has allowed a copyright lawsuit by The New York Times against OpenAI to proceed. The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI exploited the newspaper's content without permission or payment to train its artificial intelligence service, ChatGPT. The New York Times, along with other publishers, argue that OpenAI violated copyright laws by using their articles as a significant source of copyrighted text. OpenAI, however, maintains that its mass data scraping is protected under the "fair use" legal doctrine, which allows for material to be reused without permission in certain instances. The case, which is yet to have a trial date set, could have significant implications for both the news industry and the future of AI tools.


#### [Google unveils a next-gen AI reasoning model](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/25/google-unveils-a-next-gen-ai-reasoning-model/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gemini2.5.jpg?resize=1200,677)

Google has introduced Gemini 2.5, a new generation of AI reasoning models, with the first release being Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. This multimodal reasoning AI model, available on Google AI Studio and the Gemini app, is touted as Google's most intelligent model to date. The model uses additional computing power and time to fact-check and reason through problems before providing an answer, a technique that has proven beneficial in math and coding tasks. Gemini 2.5 Pro has outperformed several leading AI models in benchmarks, excelling in creating visually compelling web apps and coding applications. However, it underperformed Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet in a software development abilities test. The model can process approximately 750,000 words at once, with plans to double this capacity soon.


#### [OpenAI rolls out image generation powered by GPT-4o to ChatGPT](https://www.theverge.com/openai/635118/chatgpt-sora-ai-image-generation-chatgpt)

OpenAI has integrated a new image generation feature, known as "Images in ChatGPT", into its ChatGPT platform. This feature, powered by GPT-4o, allows users to generate images within the chat itself and is available across all subscription tiers. The new model offers significant improvements in "binding", the ability of AI image generators to maintain correct relationships between attributes and objects, and text rendering, making it easier to generate coherent text without typos on an image. The system uses an autoregressive approach, generating images sequentially from left to right and top to bottom, which may contribute to its improved text rendering and binding capabilities. Despite taking longer to generate images, OpenAI believes the enhanced quality and capabilities justify the additional wait time.

#### [Tencent‚Äôs Hunyuan T1 AI reasoning model rivals DeepSeek in performance and price](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3303456/tencents-hunyuan-t1-ai-reasoning-model-rivals-deepseek-performance-and-price)

Tencent has launched its Hunyuan T1 AI reasoning model, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning, similar to DeepSeek's R1 reasoning model. The T1 model scored 87.2 points on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) Pro benchmark, surpassing DeepSeek-R1's 84 points but falling short of OpenAI‚Äôs o1's 89.3 points. The T1 model also performed well in other benchmarks, including the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) 2024 and the C-Eval suite evaluation for Chinese language capabilities. In terms of pricing, T1 charges 1 yuan per 1 million tokens of input and 4 yuan per million tokens of output, competitive with DeepSeek's pricing. Tencent's T1 model uses a hybrid architecture combining Google‚Äôs Transformer and Mamba, which reportedly reduces training and inference costs by cutting memory usage.
