Google's DeepMind division has unveiled Project Mariner, an AI agent that can interact with the web on behalf of users. The Gemini-powered agent can control a Chrome browser, move the cursor, click buttons, and fill out forms, mimicking human interaction with websites. The agent, which is currently being tested by a small group, can perform tasks such as creating a shopping cart from a grocery list or finding flights and hotels. However, it cannot fill out credit card information or accept cookies on behalf of users. The agent works on the foremost active tab of a Chrome browser, meaning users must watch as the agent performs tasks. Google believes this new AI agent represents a significant shift in user experience, potentially changing how users interact with the web.

#### [Microsoft debuts Phi-4, a new generative AI model, in research preview](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/12/microsoft-debuts-phi-4-a-new-generative-ai-model-in-research-preview/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/microsoft-logo-office.jpg?resize=1200,798)

Microsoft has introduced Phi-4, the latest addition to its Phi series of generative AI models, which is particularly adept at solving math problems due to improved training data quality. The model, which consists of 14 billion parameters, is currently available in limited access on Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry development platform for research purposes. Phi-4's enhanced performance is attributed to the use of high-quality synthetic datasets and human-generated content, as well as unspecified post-training improvements. This release marks the first Phi-series model launch since the departure of S√©bastien Bubeck, a key figure in Microsoft's Phi model development, who left the company to join OpenAI.

Google's AI research lab, DeepMind, has announced Veo 2, a next-generation video-generating AI that can create two-minute clips in resolutions up to 4K, surpassing OpenAI's Sora in terms of resolution and duration. Veo 2, which is exclusively available on Google's experimental video creation tool, VideoFX, has an improved understanding of physics and camera controls, and produces clearer footage. The model can more realistically model motion, fluid dynamics, and properties of light, including different lenses and cinematic effects. Despite some limitations, DeepMind is working with artists and producers to refine its video-generation models and tooling. The company also announced upgrades to Imagen 3, its commercial image generation model, which can create brighter, better-composed images and photos in various styles.


#### [Pika Labs releases AI video generator 2.0 with new features](https://the-decoder.com/pika-labs-releases-ai-video-generator-2-0-with-new-features/)
![](https://the-decoder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/pika_labs_20_cat_guy.png)

Pika Labs has launched version 2.0 of its AI video generator, introducing a significant feature called "Scene Ingredients" that enables users to incorporate their own images into AI-generated videos. The AI tool works by allowing users to construct scenes from various visual components, such as pictures of people, objects, clothing, or environments, and the AI then determines the purpose of each image and merges them into a functional scene. This updated video generator, which also boasts enhanced visual quality and improved prompt adherence, will be accessible to all users, including those in the European Union, contrasting with OpenAI's Sora, which is only fully available to Pro subscribers. Pika Labs, founded by Stanford students Demi Guo and Chenlin Meng, has raised $80 million and is currently valued at $470 million.
