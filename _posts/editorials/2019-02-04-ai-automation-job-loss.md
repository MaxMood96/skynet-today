The concern of Artificial Intelligence (AI) taking over everyone’s jobs
is becoming increasingly urgent as recent AI breakthroughs (like
AlphaGo, IBM Watson, self-driving cars, and many more) attract public
attention. As AI progresses, some believe that it will steadily and
inevitably take over large sectors of the workforce and will bring
mass-scale unemployment and social unrest. One widely cited estimate,
from a 2013 Oxford study, is that as much as 47% of current US jobs are
at risk of automation [^oxford1]. Such large numbers have prompted a
myriad of fearful responses in popular media, with articles like “[The AI Revolution Is Coming—And It Will Take Your Job Sooner Than You Think](https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/10/you-will-lose-your-job-to-a-robot-and-sooner-than-you-think-2/)”
and “[New Study: Artificial Intelligence Is Coming For Your Job, Millennials](https://www.forbes.com/sites/vanessamcgrady/2017/06/09/millennial-jobs/#23d2c158530c).”

But, just how warranted are these concerns? What do history and the most
recent studies tell us about how AI based automation will impact our
jobs and the future of society? An in particular, will the impact of AI-based automation be any more significant than that of non-AI based automation enabled by computers and robotics in the past? 

After all, recent advances in more
intelligent robotics to perform physical labor and AI software to
perform mental labor follow a long line of technological developments
via automation starting from the first industrial revolution. While many
expect recent AI technologies to affect society in dramatically
different ways than technological developments in the past, evidence
supports the contrary.

AI is sometimes characterized as part of the
‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’. Today, most economists agree the prior
industrial revolutions ultimately benefited society as a whole, even
though they did result in some losing jobs to automation in the process.
Many make the case that ‘this time will be different’, and it is this
assertion that we examine in this piece. Figure by World Economic Forum,

In this article, we summarize the findings of recent studies and argue
that the impact of AI on jobs in the near future will (most likely) not
be significantly more disruptive than the impact of automation has been
in the past. The number of jobs created by AI and automation in general
will likely outnumber the jobs displaced. However, because workers of
different countries, sectors, and income-levels will be affected
differently, we still need governments to proactively enact prescriptive
labor policies to facilitate smooth workforce transitions.

Automation and Labor in the Past
--------------------------------

### The Fears

Despite the generally positive regard for the effects of past industrial
revolutions, concerns about mass unemployment as a result of new
technology still exist and trace their roots to long before such
automation was even possible. For example, in his work
[Politics](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/aristotle/Politics.pdf),
Aristotle articulated his concerns about automation in Ancient Greece
during fourth century BC:

> If every instrument could accomplish its own work, obeying or
anticipating the will of others, like the statues of Daedalus, or the
tripods of Hephaestus, which, says the poet, ‘of their own accord
entered the assembly of the gods;’ if, in like manner, the shuttle would
weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them,
chief workmen would not want servants, nor masters slaves.

Moreover, when William Lee attempted to patent his stocking frame
knitting machine in 1589, he was rebuffed by Queen Elizabeth I who
remarked: “Consider thou what the invention could do to my poor
subjects. It would assuredly bring to them ruin by depriving them of
employment, thus making them beggars”[^oxford2].

Perhaps the most well-known example of the opposition to new technology
is that of the
[Luddites](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-013-9096-y).
Though today the term refers to a general unsophisticated opposition to
progress in technology, it originally referred to an organization of
19th century English textile workers, who protested about how their jobs
were lost to new technology by destroying textile machines.

Technological progress in the first half of the twentieth century again
raised fears about mass unemployment. For example, concerns about the
disruptive impact of automation on the labor market found itself
discussed in James Joyce’s novel,
[Ulysses](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4300/4300-h/4300-h.htm).

> A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
tramway standard by Mr. Bloom’s window. Couldn’t they invent something
automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow
would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job
making the new invention?

Even though he had an optimistic view of the future in which the
standard of living would increase dramatically, John Maynard Keynes also
raised concerns about what he called ‘[technological unemployment](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-349-59072-8_25)’.
In 1964, as a response to concerns about the impact of automation on
employment opportunities, President Johnson established the [National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/technology-in-postwar-america/9780231123044).

The view of economists during this period was deeply pessimistic. For
example, [Robert Heilbroner argued that](https://economics.mit.edu/files/14458), “as machines continue to
invade society, duplicating greater and greater numbers of social tasks;
it is human labor itself – at least, as we now think of ‘labor’ – that
is gradually rendered redundant.” Moreover, one can get a good feel of
the mood of leading economists at the time from some of the chapter
titles in Ben B. Seligman’s 1966 work, [Most Notorious Victory: Man in an Age of Automation](https://archive.org/details/MostNotoriousVictoryManInAnAgeOfAutomationBenSeligman),
which include “A Babel of Calculators”, “Work Without Men”, and “The
Trauma We Await”.

These fears have persisted into recent history. The advent of personal
computers in the 1980s led to a widespread phenomenon known as
[computerphobia](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/when-people-feared-computers/388919/),
with people worrying that computers would lead to mass unemployment.
Advances in information technology, and in particular the internet, led
many in the 1990s to predict [a world without work](http://www2.itif.org/2016-myths-machine-learning.pdf) - these
same predictions are being made today about AI.

Of course, these fears are not without basis. The Industrial Revolution
is broadly seen as having been a positive development today, but for
those who lived through it it was also a turbulent transition [that caused harm as well as benefit for many](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2013/09/13/did-living-standards-improve-during-the-industrial-revolution).

### The Facts

Fears aside, it is true that automation of existing jobs has been a fact
of life for centuries. In the twentieth century, the proportion of the
workforce in agriculture decreased from 40% in 1900 to just 10% in 1950.
Now, that figure is even lower - 2%[^ncci1]. With more efficient
tools, machines, and better understanding of science, agriculture’s
productivity has soared in the last century - fewer people were needed
to do the same amount of work, and many agriculture jobs were lost. Even
more drastic trends can be observed in other countries, like China,
where one-third of the country’s workforce shifted out of agriculture
from 1990 to 2015[^mks1].

<figure>
 <img src="{{ site.imgpath }}/editorials/ai-automation-job-loss/US_labor_sector.png" alt="US labor sector."/>
  <figcaption>

manufacturing has dramatically declined in the last century, while other
job sectors have grown. Figure by <a href="https://www.ncci.com/Articles/Pages/II_Insights_QEB_Impact-Automation-Employment-Q2-2017-Part1.aspx">NCCI</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In the U.S., the impact of this seismic shift in employment from
agriculture to industrial then service sectors was smoothed by a number
of factors. In the early 20th century the U.S. made major investments to
expand secondary education. For the first time, children aged 14 to 17
were required to attend high schools, raising enrollment from 18% in
1910 to 73% in 1940[^highschool]. The 1944 G.I. Bill helped give
college education and technical training to 8 million WWII
veterans[^mks2]. Together with the U.S.’s industrialization during
the war and investment in infrastructure, these policies made American
workers among the best educated and most productive in the world. They
helped workers displaced by agricultural automation to smoothly
transition to new jobs in manufacturing, trade, and services, and many
of these jobs were also created by technological advancements.

</figure>

Sometimes automation leads to *worker displacement* - decreased
employment as many workers are replaced by a few machines. Other times
the increased productivity may actually create more jobs in the sector
that is being automated, via a process called *worker augmentation*. For
example, the rapid adoption of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) from the
1980s to the 2000s counterintuitively increased the number of bank
teller jobs throughout that period[^atm]. While the bank tellers per
bank office decreased, ATMs lowered the cost of opening new bank offices
in general, so the number of bank offices increased. This led to banks
hiring more bank-related workers and therefore also more bank tellers.
But, something did change: the job description of the bank tellers, who
began to focus more on handling customer relations as their more routine
tasks were being automated.

In addition, automation improves productivity in other sectors and can
grow the economy as a whole. The Industrial Revolution saw the
introduction of new labor saving devices and technology which did result
in [many jobs becoming obsolete](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt5hhgdm). However, this led
to new, safer, and better jobs being created an also resulted in the
[economy growing and living standards increasing](https://www.questia.com/library/84018/the-industrial-revolution-1760-1830).

Political Economist Joseph Schumpeter called this -- the process of technology disrupting industries and destroying jobs, but
ultimately creating new, better ones and growing the economy -- ["creative destruction"](https://eet.pixel-online.org/files/etranslation/original/Schumpeter,%20Capitalism,%20Socialism%20and%20Democracy.pdf). The Oxford study notes:

> Throughout history, technological progress has vastly shifted the
composition of employment, from agriculture and the artisan shop, to
manufacturing and clerking, to service and management occupations. Yet
the concern over technological unemployment has proven to be
exaggerated. \[…\] As economists have long understood, however, an
invention that replaces workers by machines will have effects on all
product and factor markets. An increase in the efficiency of production
which reduces the price of one good, will increase real income and thus
increase demand for other goods.

For example, [Research conducted by Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/growth/articles/from-brawn-to-brains--the-impact-of-technology-on-jobs-in-the-u.html)
revealed that between 2001 and 2015, technology had displaced over
800,000 jobs in the UK alone, but it had created approximately 3.5
million new ones. Claims that new technology will lead to mass
unemployment have been present throughout history, but thus far the
opposite has actually happened. As such, we should treat any similar
claims about the impact of AI with caution.

In summary, for many cases in the past, we see a story that goes roughly
like this:

1.  Technology-enabled automation displaces some workers and augments others.

2.  Displaced workers transition to new jobs, some of which are created
    by automation. The government helps to facilitate this transition
    via investments in training and education.

3.  Increased productivity raises incomes, lowers work hours (average
    work time in the U.S. has fallen more than 50% since the early
    1900s[^mks1]), and lowers prices, creating more demand for
    goods and services, leading to more jobs and broader
    economic growth.

How well do we expect this pattern to hold with AI-enabled automation in
the near future, and will they replace jobs faster than they create
them? In other words...

Is it going to be the same story with AI?
-----------------------------------------

### Defining AI

To answer the above question we first have to establish what “AI” means.
The first computer program to beat a human world champion in chess is
IBM’s Deep Blue, and it was seen as a historic milestone for AI by the
public in 1996. Today however, few would consider iPhone chess apps
examples of powerful AI, yet these apps are typically much better at
chess than Deep Blue ever was[^deepblue]. This “moving of the goal
post” for AI is often explained by the saying “[AI is whatever hasn’t been done yet.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect)” Clearly, it
is not possible to characterize the economic impact of such an
all-encompassing idea.

Instead, for the purposes of this article we will define “AI” in very
high level terms as the following: software that is optimized for a
particular task by “learning” from data, as opposed to traditional
software that is completely hand-coded by people. Today, we have “weak”
or “narrow” AI - that is, algorithms that can only be taught to tackle
single specific tasks. For example, Deep Blue was better than any human
at chess but incapable of playing checkers, and the more recent AlphaGo
was masterful at Go but could not also beat you at tic-tac-toe (in both
cases the methods could be adapted to play other games, but not without
some engineering and effort). Beyond games, this type of ‘narrowness’
applies to just about any application of AI today; an AI program
optimized to recognize faces cannot also output the color of a person’s
hair or classify them as female or male, unless specifically engineered
to do so.

All references to AI below will mean this “weak” or “narrow” variety. In
this article we do not consider “strong” or “generalized” AI, a type of
AI that is theoretically capable of (super)human-level intelligence
across a broad range of skills. Most AI researchers believe that
[strong AI is unlikely to materialize in the near future,](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114362/ai-artificial-general-intelligence-when-achieved-martin-ford-book)
and even weak AI is likely to have outsized impacts on jobs and the
economy.

task better and cheaper than human workers.” Little can be predicted
with high confidence, but the consensus appears to be that HMLI will not
be developed over the next few decades. Figure by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08807">(Grace et
al)</a>.

### Job Augmentation

Researchers made significant progress in AI over the last decade or so.
We hear news of AI beating or approaching human level performance in
games ([Go](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/),
[Dota](http://openai.com/five/), [Poker](https://www.deepstack.ai/),
[Jeopardy](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17jeopardy-watson.html)),
robots performing tasks outside of manufacturing ([mall
security](https://www.knightscope.com/), [flipping
burgers](https://misorobotics.com/), [backflipping
humanoid](https://youtu.be/fRj34o4hN4I)), and impressive results in
pattern recognition and generation ([classifying images](https://medium.com/comet-app/review-of-deep-learning-algorithms-for-image-classification-5fdbca4a05e2),
[writing news articles](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/guide_to_automated_journalism.php/),
[composing music](https://www.nanalyze.com/2018/05/11-startups-ai-compose-music/),
[drawing human faces](https://medium.com/syncedreview/gan-2-0-nvidias-hyperrealistic-face-generator-e3439d33ebaf),

[making phone appointments](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/19/google-duplex-restaurant-reservation-review.html)).
Just see how machine-generated faces have improved over a span of 5 years:

  </figcaption>
</figure>

All of this have led many to speculate that AI and AI-powered robots are
coming for everyone’s jobs, and this time is [going to be different](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU) from how automation affected
society in the past, because this time automation is automating
“non-routine” labor. As well characterized in the Oxford
study[^oxford3]:

> “Historically, computerisation has largely been confined to manual
and cognitive routine tasks involving explicit rule-based activities
(Autor and Dorn, 2013; Goos, et al. , 2009). Following recent
technological advances, however, computerisation is now spreading to
domains commonly defined as non-routine. The rapid pace at which tasks
that were defined as non-routine only a decade ago have now become
computerisable is illustrated by Autor, *et al*. (2003), asserting that:
“Navigating a car through city traffic or deciphering the scrawled
handwriting on a personal check – minor undertakings for most adults –
are not routine tasks by our definition.” Today, the problems of
navigating a car and deciphering handwriting are sufficiently well
understood that many related tasks can be specified in computer code and
automated (Veres, et al. , 2011; Plötz and Fink, 2009).”

Some speculate that AI may become so advanced as to make human labor
obsolete, much as the dawn of automobiles made horses largely obsolete
as a means of transportation. The video below,“Humans Need Not Apply,”
describes this fear that due to advances in AI, many humans will soon
become unemployable through no fault of their own:

<figure>

</figure>

While these concerns have some merit, most who express them extrapolate
the impact of AI from newsworthy demos that are cherry-picked by the
source companies or research groups. These technologies still require a
lot of human input, and it’s very difficult to apply advances in games
and pattern recognition to fully perform human jobs. Unbeknownst to many
viewers, Boston Dynamics’ [door-opening robots](https://youtu.be/fUyU3lKzoio) are [remote controlled](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/boston-dynamics-robotics-roboticist-how-to-watch),
and while IBM Watson won Jeopardy, it is struggling at its real goals in
[bringing AI to healthcare](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/robotics/artificial-intelligence/layoffs-at-watson-health-reveal-ibms-problem-with-ai). Finally, as we already established that AI is most likely staying in the
‘narrow’ domain for the foreseeable future, this “humans becoming
obsolete” scenario is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Instead, AI is
much more likely to augment workers of many jobs, not replace them.

For blue-collar jobs, take the example of self-driving trucks, which
[numerous startups](https://www.salon.com/2018/07/22/these-6-companies-are-making-the-self-driving-truck-a-reality_partner/)
are working on. Many are worried that they will threaten the jobs of
more than 3.5 million American truck drivers. The more likely scenario
is that truck drivers will be responsible for city driving and in
complex road conditions, while driving on highways will be
automated[^trucks]. CEO of Waymo, the self-driving car company that
[recently began its ride-hailing service in Arizona](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/waymo-launches-self-driving-car-service-waymo-one/),
says that self-driving cars that can handle all road conditions without
human input [will never exist](https://www.cnet.com/news/alphabet-google-waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-autonomous-cars-wont-ever-be-able-to-drive-in-all-conditions/).
The previous CEO of Uber also claims for a taxi service using a lot of
self-driving cars, due to the need for human interventions, [the number of human drivers might actually increase](https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-self-driving-cars-wont-destroy-driver-jobs-2016-8).

In addition, the American Trucking Association reports that the U.S. is
actually facing an acute truck driver labor shortage, as the industry
needs to hire 90,000 new drivers per year for the next decade to meet
demand, 33% of which are due to industry growth and not retiring drivers
[^ata]. In response, Walmart recently [raised trucking wages to attract more truck drivers](http://fortune.com/2019/01/23/walmart-truck-driver-trucking-shortage/).
The [American Center for Mobility says](https://www.acmwillowrun.org/automated-vehicles-will-create-a-shift-in-workforce-demands/)
that self-driving truck technology “has the potential to lead to the
creation of thousands of new jobs in the engineering, data analysis,
cybersecurity and vehicle ‘monitoring’ areas”. Considering the growing
demand for trucking and the need for skilled human drivers in many road
conditions, the Global Innovation Lead of the World Road Transportation
Organization claims [“autonomous vehicles are not going to take away jobs.”](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/automation-is-inevitable-but-will-not-displace-driver-jobs-iru)

Lastly, like other jobs mentioned in this article, truck driving consists of many tasks, some of which have high automation potential, and some don't.
Even if truck driving can be fully automated, other tasks that truck drivers routinely perform such as customer service, loading and unloading cargo, and vehicle maintenace have much lower automation potential, so [it is unlikely that self-driving trucks will replace truck drivers alone](https://hbr.org/2019/09/automation-isnt-about-to-make-truckers-obsolete).

As for white-collar jobs, a legal-tech startup was in the news earlier
this year for [beating a team of human lawyers at reviewing contracts](https://www.lawgeex.com/AIvsLawyer), spotting 94% of the
legal risks versus an average of 85% for the 20 human lawyers. This tool
however, will not replace lawyers as they perform more functions than
just reviewing contracts. It will likely open up valuable times for
lawyers, allowing them to focus on more higher-level tasks. The startup
even states in its study that their contract-reviewing AI “is not meant
to be, nor indeed is it currently capable of being, used as a standalone
tool.”

A similar observation can be made about the so-called “creative AIs.”
Google’s [Project Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) uses
machine learning to create new sounds and automate parts of the music
production process. Far from replacing artists, a quick glance at its
[tools](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/demos) shows how AI can augment
artists by expediting tedious tasks such as music transcription and
picking out interesting sounds. The creator of [Latent Loops](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/composing-palettes), an
AI-powered software that helps musicians discover new melodies, says:

> Drum machines didn’t put drummers out of business, even though
people were skeptical of them at first. They also didn’t make it so that
every person on earth could construct a sick beat. They did, however,
enable new types of musicians to express themselves in new ways. And
have a huge impact on the way music sounds today.

These examples show how AI-powered augmentation can make workers more
efficient and enable them to perform more complex jobs at higher levels.
Importantly, humans are still needed for these roles. Professor [Ken Goldberg](https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/bio.html),
a leading robotics researcher, calls this “[Multiplicity](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UzPdp51v8K1uut7-OWj8j5i3Kii3CFhh2mxYwX1cTlQ/edit)”, where diverse combinations of people and machines work together to solve
problems and innovate. He notes:

> A combination of collective intelligence with AI enables many of
the most sophisticated and effective systems in use today; and if people
stopped providing input, these systems would quickly become outdated and
deteriorate. \[...\] The most important question we're facing is not,
"When will machines surpass human intelligence?" but instead "How can
humans work together with machines in new ways?"

Most of the recent advances in AI in pattern recognition and predictive
modeling are driven by the increasing amount of data modern computers
can handle, and a recent study found that [no job can be fully automated by this type of AI](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20181019). As
such, extrapolating AI’s competency at performing a small part of a job
to claim that AI will replace humans to do the entire job is not valid.

But, if not by such extrapolation, how does the Oxford study conclude
that 47% of jobs are at high risk for automation? Even if augmentation
will be part of the story, surely some jobs will be lost. Which jobs
will be most impacted, and how does that compare to job displacement
caused by automation in the past? Even if the apocalyptic ‘humans
obsolete’ future is not coming, how worried should we be about what is?

### Job Displacement

To assess the impact of AI-enabled software and robotics on job
displacement, many studies[^studies] have taken a task-based
approach: list all the tasks that a person needs to perform for a job,
then see what proportion of all the tasks in a job is automatable with
current and near-future technology.

According to the Oxford study, the jobs that are **not** automatable in
the near future are ones with tasks that relate to these
“computerisation bottlenecks”:

-   perception and manipulation (e.g. dexterous manipulation of objects/tools),

-   creative intelligence (e.g. creative problem solving, the arts),

-   social intelligence (e.g. understanding others’ emotions, negotiation/persuasion, assisting and caring for others).

By filtering out jobs that involve such tasks, the Oxford study arrived
at the number that currently 47% of U.S. jobs are automatable. Note that
**this is not an estimate of how many jobs will be lost to automation, just how many jobs can be theoretically automated.**

<figure>
 <img src="{{ site.imgpath }}/editorials/ai-automation-job-loss/automatable_jobs.png" alt="automatable_jobs"/>
  <figcaption>
How much time is automatable for different jobs. Figure by <a href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/411666/ado2018.pdf">Asian Development Bank</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

A more recent, in-depth study by McKinsey gives a more nuanced estimate - by 2030 60% of jobs will be made up of tasks that are at least 30%
automatable[^mks3], **but less than 5% of jobs will be fully automatable**[^mks4].

The jobs most susceptible to automation are the ones in data keeping
(e.g. record clerks, office assistants), low-level customer interaction
(e.g. hotel/travel booking, cashiers, food service workers), and other
jobs with predictable, highly routine tasks (e.g. assembly line workers,
dishwashers, drivers)[^mks5]. Like the bank tellers in the ATM
example however, it is likely that the workers of many of these
automatable jobs will be augmented by new technology instead. Gartner
estimates that by 2022, 20% of workers who perform nonroutine tasks will
rely on AI to do the job (e.g. automatically generating reports, picking
top emails to read)[^gartner].

McKinsey estimates that worldwide by 2030 automation will only displace
15% of workers[^mks6], and at most 14% of the global workforce will
need to switch job categories[^mks7], even though 60% of jobs will be
susceptible to automation[^mks8]. A study by OECD reports similar
statistics: about 14% of jobs across OECD countries will be highly
automatable, while 50-70% of jobs will have a third of the tasks
susceptible to automation[^oecd1]. Another study by the University of
Mannheim gives an even lower estimate - only 9% of jobs in the U.S. are
at high risk of automation[^manheim]. These studies arrived at lower numbers than the Oxford one by taking a more granular approach, accounting for the variations in tasks across jobs within the same type of occupation.

Yet, this is only part of the picture. Due to the cost of technology
adoption (e.g. the cost of acquiring and integrating new technology,
following regulations, and overcoming social and cultural norms), just
because a job can be automated does not mean that it will be. The Oxford
study actually clarifies that:

> We focus on estimating the share of employment that can
potentially be substituted by computer capital, from a technological
capabilities point of view, over some unspeciﬁed number of years. We
make no attempt to estimate how many jobs will actually be automated.
The actual extent and pace of computerisation will depend on several
additional factors which were left unaccounted for.

While cheap labor jobs in restaurants, services, and manufacturing have
the highest automation risks, they may have much lower automation
penetration. Upgrading infrastructure, especially hardware, is sometimes
just not worth the cost. For example, electricity-powered factories are
much more cost-efficient than steam-powered ones, but electrification is
a costly process, and it took more than 4 decades for half of U.S.
factories to be electrified after the idea became
realizable[^electricity]. Even replacing humans with robots in repetitive jobs such as those in manufacturing and warehouse fulfillment requires "breakthroughs in work design that often take years or even decades to achieve."[^wotf_robots] In addition, marginally increasing the cost of cheap labor may not incentivize automation as much as perceived;
studies have found that increasing the minimum wage in Seattle to
\$15/hr had no perceptible effect on the city’s jobs being
automated[^seattle].

Taking adoption rate into account, the National Council on Compensation
Insurance (NCCI) estimates in its baseline scenarios that **only 4% of
the U.S. workforce will be displaced by automation by 2024** (the
top-end estimate, by tripling the expected automation adoption rate, is
13.7%).

While the number of jobs displaced by automation is not as scary as many
make it out to be, **what is of concern is that automation will not
displace jobs evenly across countries, industries, education level,
socioeconomic status, age, and gender**. Such disparity may have
socially and politically destabilizing effects.

NCCI projects that relative to 2014, by 2024, U.S. manufacturing will
lose 1.6 million workers, with automation replacing 6.9% of
manufacturing jobs in addition to expected employment losses due to
other factors. The same study also reports that information,
agriculture, and retail sectors will employ 200,000 fewer workers.
Workers in small, rural areas will also be [more affected by
automation](https://www.brookings.edu/research/automation-and-artificial-intelligence-how-machines-affect-people-and-places/)
than those in urban areas.

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Developed countries will see a higher proportion of jobs automated than
developing ones due to higher wages and aging populations[^mks9].
Differences also exist within developed countries - Japan will likely
see more of its jobs automated than the U.S. because its share of labor
in highly automatable sectors is higher[^mks10].

The sectors at the most risk for automation tend to be middle-income
jobs requiring only secondary or associate level education. Demand for
these middle-income jobs and employment opportunities for those with low
educational attainment will decline as demand for high-wage,
high-educational attainment workers improve (see figure below). This
plus other ways that automation concentrates wealth will
[exacerbate the income and wealth inequality problem in advanced economies](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/the-future-is-automated-but-what-does-that-really-mean-for-jobs),
especially the U.S., where the benefits of automation increasingly flow
to a smaller number of people who can afford good education and own the
automation technologies.

</figure>

Automation-induced job loss will also affect men more than women, as men
make up between 70 to 80% of jobs in manufacturing, agriculture,
transportation, and warehousing, sectors with the highest risks of
automation[^ncci1]. And, automation will impact young and old workers
more than middle-aged ones. Although the youth side of this U-curve is
much worse than the other as entry-level jobs tend to have higher risks
of automation, young workers tend to be better at finding and adapting
to new jobs than senior workers [^oecd2].

Lastly, automation may also decrease wages for workers in the more
automatable industries. To quickly supplant lost income, workers
displaced by automation often [settle for jobs that pay less than the job they had before](https://futurism.com/new-chart-proves-automation-serious-threat). One study finds that one more robot per a thousand workers decreases
wages by 0.37%[^ace1]. While automation has the potential to reduce
the risk of injury for dangerous jobs, doing so may also lead to reduced
wages for workers in those jobs[^ncci1].

**In short, the concern that AI and other forms of automation will take over everyone’s jobs is unwarranted**. Automation will probably displace
less than 15% of jobs in the near future, and not nearly as many as 47%.
This is because many jobs will be augmented, not replaced, and
widespread adoption of new technology is a slow process that incurs
nontrivial costs. Historically, shifts this large or larger have already
happened and ultimately led to growing prosperity for people on average
in the long term. However, automation can exacerbate the problems of
income and wealth inequality, and its uneven impact means some
communities will be affected much more than others[^ineq]. Helping displaced
workers to quickly transition to and succeed in new jobs will be a tough
and important challenge.

### Job Creation

Jobs displaced by automation form only one part of the net employment equation. To see how the total number of jobs will change in the near future, we should also look at jobs created by automation as well.

Automation can create new jobs directly through the production, maintenance, and sales of its products and services. But, it creates even more jobs indirectly by improving the productivity of other industries. McKinsey estimates that since the 1980s, personal computers (PCs) have created 15.8 million net new jobs in the U.S., making up about 10% of workforce[^mks11]. While PCs displaced jobs in bookkeeping and secretarial work, it created many new jobs that didn’t exist before, such as those in manufacturing high-tech components and those that use PCs, like IT support services, call centers, and e-commerce. About 18% of jobs in the U.S. today did not exist in 1980[^mks1], while the demand for these new jobs will rise to 8~9% by 2030[^mks10].

Contrary to what some might’ve expected, PCs and the Internet increased the demand for information analysts, even as data collection and analysis became highly automated[^mks12]. The number of analysts grew from 400,000 in 1980 to 2 million in 2015, as more analysts are needed to make sense of the ever increasing amount of data collected. Similar scaling effects can be observed in other jobs, especially technology-related jobs, that benefit from automation, and it is projected that by 2030 tech jobs will grow from 20 to 50 million[^mks13]. Gartner also estimates that by 2020, AI will create 2.3 million jobs and displace 1.8 million, yielding a net positive, albeit the jobs lost and gained will not be in the same industries[^gartner].

Ronald Bailey nicely summarizes in his
[article](http://reason.com/archives/2017/06/06/are-robots-going-to-steal-our)
how recent advances in computing created many jobs that didn’t exist
before:

> Since the advent of the smartphone just 10 years ago, for example,
an "app economy" has emerged that "now supports an astounding 1.66
million jobs in the United States," Progressive Policy Institute
economist Michael Mandel reports. According to the Entertainment
Software Association, more than 220,000 jobs now depend on the game
software industry. The IBISWorld consultancy estimates that 227,000
people work in web design, while the Biotechnology Innovation
Organization says that U.S. bioscience companies employ 1.66 million
people. Robert Cohen, a senior fellow at the Economic Strategy
Institute, projects that business spending on cloud services will
generate nearly \$3 trillion more in gross domestic product and 8
million new jobs from 2015 to 2025.

Automation can also create new jobs by enabling efficient, scalable
marketplaces for sharing people’s previously unused resources (e.g.
Uber, Airbnb) and paying people to do previously unpaid work. Domestic
work such as cooking, childcare, and cleaning will see greater
participation by paid labor, and this trend has already been observed in
advanced economies[^mks14].

Taking into account of positive spillover effects (e.g. cheaper prices
from robot-produced goods), a recent study reports that for industrial
robotic automation, the number of workers directly displaced by 1 more
robot per thousand workers decreases from 6 to 3.3 in the
U.S.[^ace2]. Worldwide however, a [study by Muro and
Andes](https://hbr.org/2015/06/robots-seem-to-be-improving-productivity-not-costing-jobs)
found no statistically significant correlation between increase in the
use of industrial robots and decrease in manufacturing jobs. The
International Federation of Robotics also projects that robots will
create between [1.9 million and 3.5 million new jobs by 2021](https://ifr.org/img/office/IFR_The_Impact_of_Robots_on_Employment.pdf).

But in general, there isn’t a wide consensus on the exact number of jobs
created by AI in the near future. This [MIT Tech Review article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610005/every-study-we-could-find-on-what-automation-will-do-to-jobs-in-one-chart/)
shows how such estimates differ by the millions from different sources,
even for numbers reporting the same time frame for the same country.

What is clear from history and current demographic and economic trends
however, is that most of the new jobs in the near future, whether or not
they’re created by automation, will not be the same jobs displaced by
automation, and many displaced workers will have to find ways to switch
occupational sectors.

Preparing for what is to come
-----------------------------

Rising income and consumption, especially as large middle classes emerge
in developing countries, will push global consumption to grow by \$23
trillion from 2015 to 2030, leading to overall job and economic
growth[^mks15]. Job growth is also expected in newly developed
industries, such as in renewable energies (which is expected to add 20
million new jobs by 2030)[^mks16].

The [aging population](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/973571468174557899/Averting-the-old-age-crisis-policies-to-protect-the-old-and-promote-growth)
of many developed nations will induce drastic changes in labor demand
for some sectors, and healthcare is one prime example. By 2030 worldwide
there will be at least 300 million more people over the age of 65 than
there were in 2014[^mks15], and in the U.S. Americans over 65 will
grow from 45 to 65 million in the same time frame[^ncci1]. Healthcare
jobs are also very difficult to automate, owing to the necessity of
human-to-human interactions. Together this means we will see significant
increases in the demand for healthcare related jobs, as they are
projected to grow by 80 to 130 million by 2030 worldwide[^mks13].

Similar to how jobs displaced by automation varies across different
communities, so are the jobs gained. Countries with a growing workforce
(like India) will face more challenges keeping all the available, young
workers employed than countries with a shrinking workforce (like
Japan)[^mks10]. Sectors that are expected to grow and are less likely
to be automated, like education and healthcare, currently employ more
women than men, with women making up 79% of the workforce in healthcare
and social assistance and 68% in education[^ncci1].

  </figcaption>
</figure>

It is important for workers who are displaced by automation to quickly
switch to sectors that are experiencing growth. Notably, McKinsey
estimates that the increase in investment and productivity from
automation can lead to enough economic growth for full employment,
**only if displaced workers switch to new jobs within a year**[^mks18]. While the current mean duration for unemployment in
the U.S. is about [4 months (21 weeks)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UEMPMEAN), this has been
slowly rising in the past decades, and will get worse if automation
replaces jobs faster than workers can be retrained.

Slow reemployment generally leads to lower wages as workers are more
likely to settle for lower paying jobs the longer they’re unemployed.
During the British Industrial Revolution, real wages stagnated for about
50 years as productivity rose, a phenomenon called “Engels’ Pause”[^engels]. As it took decades for productivity gained by
automation to benefit the masses, life for workers during that
transition period was tough, as [described in one article](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/21st-century-automation-time-truly-different/):

> The gains from the early 19th century didn’t materialize
overnight. In fact, this period saw unprecedented social disruption,
stagnant wages, uncomfortable adjustments to civic life, and greater
environmental pollution for the people living through it.

  </figcaption>
</figure>

An effective way to help displaced workers to adjust is through job
training, either for new jobs or upskilling for current jobs. This is
especially important as advances in automation can reduce the required
skills of workers, making them less valuable and more vulnerable to
replacement in the future. In describing Amazon’s automated warehousing
system that constantly adapts its seemingly chaotic stock patterns,
[Jerry Kaplan writes](https://www.salon.com/2015/08/23/robots_are_coming_for_your_job_we_must_fix_income_inequality_volatile_job_markets_now_or_face_sustained_turmoil/):

> A side effect of introducing \[automated warehouse management] is
that it reduces the training and knowledge required of warehouse
workers, making them more susceptible to replacement by forged laborers.
These employees no longer have to be familiar with the location of
products on the shelves; indeed, it would be near impossible to do so in
such a haphazard and evolving environment. Having first simplified the
skills required to get the job done, Amazon can now replace the workers
that roam the warehouse floor picking those orders.

Adequately upskilling workers however, is unlikely to happen at the
necessary rate and scale without government intervention. According to
the OECD study, participating in both on or off the job training is
significantly less likely for workers in highly automatable jobs than
those with less automatable jobs[^oecd3]. The contrast is apparent
for participating in formal education and other types of distant
learning as well. And, due to the speed of current technological development,
training workers at a sufficient rate will be harder than it had been in
the past. As Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee state in their book
“[The Second Machine Age](http://secondmachineage.com/)”:

> Once one concedes that it takes time for workers and organizations
to adjust to technical change, then it becomes apparent that
accelerating technical change can lead to widening gaps and increasing
possibilities for technological unemployment.

A recent report observes this effect in the last three decades, noting that the acceleration of automation-induced job displacement, especially in manufacturing, combined with slower productivity growth during the same time period, has led to slower employment growth[^ace3].

Thus, as concluded in Graham Brown-Martin’s “[Education and the Fourth Industrial Revolution](https://www.groupemediatfo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/FINAL-Education-and-the-Fourth-Industrial-Revolution-1-1-1.pdf)”:

> Workers, for their part and supported by government, have to be
strategic and aim for the jobs least likely to be overtaken by robots or other machines. They have to commit
to a lifetime of practicing and updating their skills by, for example, taking extra courses online
and in classrooms. Lifelong learning, agility and continued training and retraining are key.

From the G.I. Bill and the high school education movement last century
we know it is possible to train and upskill workers in mass, but
proactive policies are definitely needed to make that happen.

<figure>

  <figcaption>

are less likely to undertake job training. Figure by <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/employment/automation-skills-use-and-training_2e2f4eea-en">OECD</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

In the U.S., one option to facilitate scalable job training is letting community colleges offer occupational classes or connect students with apprenticeship-like positions.
Community colleges are especially poised to do this "given their scale, their ability to adapt offerings to local market needs, and their ongoing engagement with non-baccalaureate adults at all career states"[^wotf_cc].
Other non-degree credential job-oriented education models like bootcamps, which avoids the student debt and over-education issues with four-year degrees, are also seeing some successes[^wotf_exp].

Another way to increase the fluidity of the labor market, especially for
young workers, is through the gig economy, but this approach is not
without its drawbacks. While the likes of Uber and Taskrabbit can help
workers more easily engage in freelance work, these jobs are far less
stable and provide far fewer employment benefits than traditional full
time jobs, and it’s unclear how jobs in the gig economy can lead to more
permanent jobs with higher wages.

The McKinsey study lists many other potential ideas that can strengthen
support for workers during job transitions, such as unemployment
insurance, universal basic income (UBI), and tying gains in wage to
those in productivity[^mks17]. Fiscal policies that incentive human over physical capital, such as Bill Gates' proposed [robot tax](https://qz.com/911968/bill-gates-the-robot-that-takes-your-job-should-pay-taxes/) and tax credits for providing worker training[^wotf_tax], can also be considered.

UBI, which gives everyone a set amount of money per month regardless of
employment status, has particularly captured the public attention in
recent years. The concept is not new as it was seriously considered
during the [Nixon presidency](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/05/richard-nixon-ubi-basic-income-welfare/).
Proponents of UBI say this money will enable workers to participate in
job training for new jobs without worrying about basic necessities,
while critics fear that UBI is too expensive and cannot effectively
replace existing welfare programs. Many cities and countries are
currently [experimenting with UBI](https://basicincome.org/news/2018/07/current-ubi-experiments-an-update-for-july-2018/),
and it remains to be seen how effective it will be at improving labor
market mobility and helping displaced workers transition to new jobs.

The take home message is this: just as with past employment shifts
caused by technology, active, anticipatory measures in cross-sector work
training and economic support during transition periods will be key to
helping people who are negatively affected by AI-based automation. This
may require a mix of old and new approaches, but one thing is clear:
these policies will need to be proactive, and significant.

Conclusion
----------

[In a 2018 article](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/opinion/view/404), the authors
of the Oxford study notes that in comparison to recent estimates on jobs
at risk of displacement by automation:

> Seen through the lens of the twentieth century, our estimate, that
47% of jobs are exposed to future automation, does not seem
extraordinarily high. On the contrary, the University of Mannheim and
the OECD estimates seem extremely low.

For developed countries, increased automation is also happening against a backdrop of a shrinking working population. From [MIT's Work of the Future Report](https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/WorkoftheFuture_Report_Shaping_Technology_and_Institutions.pdf):

> Contrary to the conventional narrative in which automation renders jobs increasingly scarce, we anticipate that, due to slowing labor force growth rates, rising ratios of retirees to workers, and increasingly restrictive immigration policies, over the next two decades industrialized countries will be grappling with more job openings than able-bodied adults to fill them.

To the best of current projections, by 2030, around 15% of jobs will be
at high risk of displacement by automation, and less than 5% of jobs
will be fully automatable. As such, AI-enabled automation will not
disrupt jobs in the near future more than automation has in the past
(e.g. the percentage of U.S. workers in agriculture fell from 40% in
1900 to 2% now). This is mainly because:

1.  Recent AI developments, while seemingly impressive, are still very
    narrow and require a lot of human input and supervision. These
    AI-powered tools can only replace some tasks of jobs and will
    augment many workers, not replace them.
2.  Adopting new technology is much slower than developing them due to
    cost in implementation and maintenance, as well as overcoming
    cultural and regulatory hurdles.

Automation will however, impact some communities much more than others
for different countries, industries, education level, socioeconomic
status, age, and gender, and these disparities may have socially and
politically destabilizing effects.

Most new jobs in the future, whether or not they’re created by
automation, will not be in the same field as the ones disrupted by
automation. Healthcare is likely the sector with the fastest growing
labor demand due to the increasing population of elders: worldwide by
2030, there will be 300 million more people over 65 than there were at
2014.

For secured economic growth and avoiding lowering wages, it is important
for displaced workers to retrain and find new jobs within a year. This
is unlikely to happen without government intervention, as workers whose
jobs are most automatable receive the least job training. The bright
side is we know facilitating large shifts in employment composition is
possible - U.S. made big investments in the G.I. Bill and mandatory
secondary education last century, helping American workers move out of
agriculture and into other sectors.

In closing, we highlight that fear mongering about AI taking everyone’s
jobs, and AI in general, is unwarranted and does not lead to productive
dialogue. Seeing recent AI advances in a broader, historical context
reveals that this trend of automation has been around for a long time.
And just as we have with technologies in the past, with smart policies,
AI can improve everyone’s quality of life in the long run.

[^ineq]: As emphasized in this [report](https://workofthefuture.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2019-09/WorkoftheFuture_Report_Shaping_Technology_and_Institutions.pdf), inequality is less acute in other industrialized nations with similar levels of rising productivity and automation as the U.S. Income distribution is shaped by many factors including but not limited to educational systems, labor and financial market regulations, and fiscal policies. In other words, inequality is not wholly caused by automation, and nor will it be fixed with less automation.
