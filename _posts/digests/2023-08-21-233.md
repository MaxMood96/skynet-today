Gartner's 2023 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies places generative AI at the peak of inflated expectations, highlighting its potential for enhancing digital customer experiences and business decisions. The report identifies four key emerging technology trends: Emergent AI, Developer Experience (DevX), Pervasive Cloud, and Human-centric Security and Privacy. Emergent AI includes techniques like AI simulation, causal AI, and federated machine learning. DevX focuses on improving interactions between developers and their tools, with technologies like AI-augmented software engineering and API-centric SaaS. The Pervasive Cloud trend predicts cloud computing becoming an essential driver of business innovation, enabled by technologies like cloud development environments and cloud sustainability. Human-centric Security and Privacy emphasizes the need for a security and privacy program that integrates into an organization's digital design, supported by technologies like AI TRISM and postquantum cryptography.

#### [The New York Times prohibits AI vendors from devouring its content](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/the-new-york-times-prohibits-ai-vendors-from-devouring-its-content/)

The New York Times (NYT) has updated its terms of service to prohibit the scraping of its content for AI training, a practice used by tech companies to enhance the capabilities of AI language apps like ChatGPT and Google Bard. The new terms explicitly forbid the use of NYT content, including articles, videos, images, and metadata, for training any AI model without express written permission. The move comes amid controversy over the use of scraped data for AI training, which has led to legal challenges, including a lawsuit accusing OpenAI of plagiarism. OpenAI has begun taking steps to address these concerns, detailing a method for websites to block its AI-training web crawler. However, it remains to be seen whether AI vendors will respect these new terms, with potential legal and regulatory consequences looming.

#### [FEC could limit AI in political ads ahead of 2024](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/10/23827399/ai-artificial-intelligence-political-ads-fec-desantis-rnc)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axNbioQEuORdBh_cSwrl0OWZZUA=/0x0:4176x2784/1200x628/filters:focal(2088x1392:2089x1393)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24842499/1548124131.jpg)

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) is considering implementing rules to regulate the use of AI-generated content in political ads. The decision follows a petition from advocacy group Public Citizen, which calls for the FEC to create rules that prevent candidates and political parties from using AI to misrepresent their opponents. The FEC has opened the petition for public comment, a process that could result in new rules being in place by the end of the year. However, there are concerns about whether the FEC has the necessary authority to implement these rules, with some suggesting that federal lawmakers should take action first. This comes amid increasing use of AI in political campaigns and a growing push from Congress and the White House to regulate the technology.

#### [As Hollywood Strikes, 96% Of Entertainment Companies Are Boosting Generative AI Spend](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2023/08/16/as-hollywood-strikes-96-of-entertainment-companies-are-boosting-generative-ai-spend/)
![](https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/64dd0929225a3e959888000c/The-Hollywood-sign-sits-on-Mount-Lee-in-Hollywood-/960x0.jpg)

As the Hollywood writer's strike surpasses 100 days, nearly all entertainment and media companies are planning to increase expenditures on generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). This stems from a report by Lucidworks that indicates that 96% of global executives involved in AI decisions are prioritizing generative AI investments. The trend is leading globally, with 100% of companies in China, 98% in India, 95% in France, 94% in the UK, and 92% in the USA investing in generative AI. Amid fears of AI's potential impact on professions, the entertainment industry is rapidly moving to incorporate or purchase generative AI technology. This could potentially lead to 90% of Hollywood content being at least partly AI-generated by 2025. Furthermore, the emergence of synthetic actors through AI technologies could pose a genuine threat to the industry's talent pool.
