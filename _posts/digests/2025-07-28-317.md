#### [White House Releases AI Action Plan to Cement U.S. Leadership](https://natlawreview.com/article/white-house-reveals-ai-action-plan)
![](https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-07/President%20Donald%20Trump%20White%20House%20Website-211799041.jpg.webp?itok=a56S0EFq)

On July 23, 2025, the White House introduced "Winning the AI Race: Americaâ€™s AI Action Plan," a detailed strategy to solidify U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence (AI). This plan, following President Trump's executive order on Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI, outlines over 90 federal policy actions across three pillars: Accelerating Innovation, Building American AI Infrastructure, and Leading in International Diplomacy and Security. The initiative aims to usher in a new era of human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security for the American people.

Key policies in the AI Action Plan include exporting American AI through partnerships between the Commerce and State Departments and industry, promoting rapid buildout of data centers, enabling innovation and adoption by removing federal regulations that hinder AI development, and upholding free speech in frontier models by updating federal procurement guidelines. The plan emphasizes the importance of AI as a cornerstone of American innovation and global influence, aiming to ensure that American workers and families thrive in the AI era. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios, AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, and Secretary of State and Acting National Security Advisor Marco Rubio all stressed the importance of winning the AI race for the U.S.'s economic and national security.

#### [OpenAI prepares to launch GPT-5 in August](https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/712950/openai-gpt-5-model-release-date-notepad)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/257594_NOTEPAD_OPENAI_CVirginia.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

OpenAI is gearing up to launch its next-generation model, GPT-5, as early as August, following some delays. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman describes the model as a system that integrates a lot of their technology, including the o3 reasoning capabilities. The launch will also feature mini and nano versions of GPT-5, available through OpenAI's API. This unification of the o-series and GPT-series models is part of OpenAI's ongoing efforts to simplify and combine its large language models to create a more capable system that can eventually be declared artificial general intelligence (AGI).

The declaration of AGI is significant for OpenAI as it would force Microsoft to relinquish its rights to OpenAI revenue and its future AI models. However, it is unlikely that GPT-5 will meet the AGI threshold linked to OpenAI's profits. Altman has previously stated that GPT-5 won't have a "gold level of capability for many months" after launch. OpenAI is also preparing to launch an open language model, described as similar to o3 mini, which is expected to be released before GPT-5. This new model will be the first time that OpenAI has released an open-weight model since its release of GPT-2 in 2019.

#### [Big Tech split? Google to sign EUâ€™s AI guidelines despite Meta snub](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/30/big-tech-split-google-to-sign-eus-ai-guidelines-despite-meta-snub.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108125067-1743612093512-gettyimages-2189492700-vcg111536239152.jpeg?v=1743612242&w=1920&h=1080)

Google has announced its intention to sign the European Union's guidelines on artificial intelligence (AI), a move that contrasts with Meta's decision to reject the same guidelines due to concerns about stifling innovation. Google believes that adhering to these guidelines will facilitate European citizens' access to new AI tools as they become available. The company's endorsement comes after Meta's refusal to sign the code, citing potential constraints on European AI innovation.

The European Commission, the executive body of the EU, has published a final version of its code of practice for general-purpose AI models, leaving the decision to sign up to individual companies. Google's President of Global Affairs, Kent Walker, emphasized the importance of prompt and widespread deployment of AI, suggesting that embracing AI could boost Europe's economy by 1.4 trillion euros ($1.62 trillion) annually by 2034.

#### [OpenAI launches Study Mode in ChatGPT](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/29/openai-launches-study-mode-in-chatgpt/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/OpenAI-and-ChatGPT.jpeg?resize=1200,676)

OpenAI has introduced a new feature called Study Mode in its AI chatbot, ChatGPT, aimed at fostering critical thinking skills in students. Rather than providing direct answers, the feature prompts users with questions to test their understanding of the material. The feature is being rolled out to users on Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans, with plans to introduce it to Edu subscribers in the coming weeks. This move addresses concerns that while ChatGPT can be a useful tutoring tool, it may also negatively impact students' critical thinking abilities.

Despite the potential benefits of Study Mode, there are limitations to its effectiveness. Students can easily switch back to the regular mode if they want direct answers, and currently, there are no tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. OpenAI's VP of Education, Leah Belsky, has indicated that the company may consider implementing such controls in the future. The launch of Study Mode is part of OpenAI's broader efforts to improve learning through ChatGPT, with plans to publish more information on how students use generative AI in their education.
