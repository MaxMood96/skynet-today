#### [DeepMind launches AlphaGenome, aiming to predict gene regulation from DNA sequence](https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/25/google-ai-deepmind-launches-alphagenome-new-model-to-predict-dna-encoding-gene-regulation/)

Google's AI research company, DeepMind, known for its protein-folding deep learning model AlphaFold, has recently ventured into the complex field of predicting gene regulation from DNA sequences. The company announced its latest model, AlphaGenome, in a preprint and blog post. This model represents an early step towards potential applications in therapeutic development.

DeepMind's research engineer, Natasha Latysheva, acknowledges that compared to protein structure prediction, genomics is a more ambiguous field with no single metric of success. As a result, DeepMind is pursuing multiple metrics in its quest to predict gene regulation. This move marks a significant shift in DeepMind's focus, from protein structure prediction to the more complex and less defined field of genomics.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced the creation of a new group within the company, the "Meta Superintelligence Labs", which will be responsible for all AI-related work. The group will be led by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, who recently joined Meta as part of a multibillion-dollar deal, and will be assisted by former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. In addition, Meta has made 11 new AI-focused hires, including former employees of Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI.

Zuckerberg has reportedly been making substantial offers to potential hires, with figures reaching into the eight-figure range, in an effort to boost Meta's AI capabilities, which have been lagging behind other major AI companies. The company has also been in discussions to acquire several AI companies, including Thinking Machines Lab, Perplexity, and Safe Superintelligence, although none of these talks have resulted in formal offers. Zuckerberg also mentioned in the memo that Meta plans to begin research on the next generation of AI models in the coming year.

#### [Google is bringing Gemini CLI to developersâ€™ terminals](https://www.theverge.com/news/692517/google-gemini-cli-ai-agent-dev-terminal)
![](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/Google-Gemini-CLI-hero.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200)

Google has introduced a new open-source AI agent, Gemini CLI, that brings Gemini's coding, content generation, and research capabilities directly to developers' terminals. The tool is designed to enhance the command line experience, allowing developers to write and debug code using natural language prompts. Gemini CLI uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro reasoning model, which supports a 1 million token context window, and is integrated with Gemini Code Assist. It also includes built-in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Google Search support, and enables developers to generate images and video using Google's Veo and Imagen AI tools.

Gemini CLI is currently available for developers to preview for free through a Gemini Code Assist license that can be obtained via a personal Google account. This license allows users a usage limit of 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 requests per day, which Google claims is the "largest allowance" in the industry. However, Google has not yet disclosed plans for users who exceed these usage limits or whether the AI agent will remain free when it becomes fully available.
