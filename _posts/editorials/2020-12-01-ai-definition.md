## The Options
According to [the Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artificial%20intelligence), the term 'Artificial Intelligence' has the following two definitions:

1. a branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers
2. the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior

While the two are similar in that they deal with 'intelligent behavior' in computers, they are also quite different; the first definition is about a research discipline, while the latter describes what that research discipline seeks to create. Searching on Google reinforces this dual way of defining AI, with Google's highlighted definition saying AI is "the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence", and Wikipedia's saying it is "intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals." Dictionary.com furthermore offers this definition: "a computer, robot, or other programmed mechanical device having this humanlike capacity". 

The ways in which the term 'AI' can be used depend on which of these definitions you consider valid. News articles often have titles to the effect of "Google's new AI learned X" or "A new AI can do Y," such as:
* [“An Artificial Intelligence Developed Its Own Non-Human
Language”](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/artificial-intelligence-develops-its-own-non-human-language/530436/)
* ["AI can now design cities, but should we let it?"](https://www.fastcompany.com/90455358/ai-can-now-design-cities-should-we-let-it)
* ["For The First Time Ever, A Drug Developed By AI Will Be Tested In Human Trials"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danadovey/2020/02/11/first-time-ever-artificial-intelligence-develops-drug-candidate/)
* ["Google AI creates its own ‘child’ AI that’s more advanced than systems built by humans"](https://www.sciencealert.com/google-s-ai-built-it-s-own-ai-that-outperforms-any-made-by-humans)

But, this usage is only valid with that last "a computer, robot, or other programmed mechanical device having this humanlike capacity" definition. If the first definiton is instead picked, these titles would have to be rewritten as "Google's new AI algorithm learned X" or "A new AI system can do Y." In this piece, I'll make the case that this definition and form of usage (which I will adopt for the rest of this piece) is superior to the alternatives, and should be adopted in most cases. 

## Why Should We Care
It may seem pedantic to say one of these definitions is better than any of the others, and tempting to just say all of these definitons are fine. But, there is a case to be made for using 'AI' to refer to a field of research as being better than the alternatives. That case is based on one primary fact: a [common misunderstanding](https://www.aimyths.org/ai-has-agency) about the AI programs we have today is that they are independent agents with some amount of 'free will'. In fact, what AI researchers and engineers build today are just computer programs, which are capable of emulating some aspects of human intelligence but are otherwise no more independent than the apps on our smartphones. Nevertheless, AI researchers [ranked](https://www.skynettoday.com/podcast/top-ai-myths) the idea that the AI algorithms they create have some human-like independence as the most common and problematic myth about AI; it was "was number one by a long shot" according to a survey asking which myths about AI are most common.

I believe part of why this myth is so predominent has to do with the definitions of AI that allow for sentences such as "A new AI can do Y." Expanding that sentence results in "A new Artificial Intelligence can do Y," and the notion that the sentence refers to 'An Intelligence' inevitably implies agency similar to those of animals and humans. AI researcher Julian Togelius addresses this notion well in his blog post [“Some advice for journalists writing
about artificial intelligence”](http://togelius.blogspot.com/2017/07/some-advice-for-journalists-writing.html):

> **Keep in mind**: There is no such thing as "an artificial
> intelligence". AI is a collection of methods and ideas for building
> software that can do some of the things that humans can do with their
> brains. Researchers and developers develop new AI methods (and use
> existing AI methods) to build software (and sometimes also hardware)
> that can do something impressive, such as playing a game or drawing
> pictures of cats.

AI researcher Zachary Lipton made this point more bluntly:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en"

stop saying "an AI". AI's an aspirational term, not a

As someone who has tried to use my knowledge as an AI researcher to address popular misconceptions about AI, I have observed and continue to observe the usage of "An AI" often, and think it has the negative side effect of feeding misunderstanding of what AI is today. Therefore, while perhaps still a bit pedantic, I think it is still fair to make the case that AI researchers' usage of the term 'AI' is better than the alternatives.

## How Researchers Define AI

John McCarthy, one of the founders of the field of AI, defined AI as follows:

> "It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs."

Professor Christopher Manning [recently cited](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/AI-Definitions-HAI.pdf) this as the definition of AI. Similarly, in “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach”, Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig defined AI as:

> “the designing and building of intelligent agents that receive percepts from the environment and take actions that affect that environment.”

There are of course many other definitions, but they tend to share the quality of considering AI a research or engineering discipline rather than a term that can be used to refer to singular algorithms or systems. 

I conducted an informal survey to check whether AI researchers generally agree with this form of definition, with the following results:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">AI Researchers: how do you define the term &#39;Artificial Intelligence&#39;? <br><br>A: the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs<br><br>B: intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence of animals<br><br>C: Other</p>&mdash; Skynet Today (@skynet_today) <a href="https://twitter.com/skynet_today/status/1326239401912004611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

While hardly a careful study of what most AI researchers feel, the result of this poll agrees with my personal observations as an AI researchers that most in the field prefer the John McCarthy definition of AI to the alternatives. 

## TLDR 
AI researchers tend to define 'Artificial Intelligence' to mean something along the lines of "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs". This is in contrast to definitions often used in popular media, which use 'AI' to refer to particular programs or systems. The latter usage of AI reinforces an already common myth that present day AI has some amount of human-like agency, when in fact this is not really the case. Therefore, researchers often dislike the 'An AI' type definition, and use 'AI' to refer to a field of research.
