#### [OpenAI releases o1, its first model with ‚Äòreasoning‚Äô abilities](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242439/openai-o1-model-reasoning-strawberry-chatgpt)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2e0-IzeyJ7KzcdVPwSc9wHJt9zc=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25462005/STK155_OPEN_AI_CVirginia_B.jpg)

OpenAI has launched a new model, o1, the first in a series of "reasoning" models designed to answer complex questions more quickly than humans. This model, released alongside a smaller, cheaper version called o1-mini, represents a significant step towards achieving human-like artificial intelligence. Unlike previous models, o1 has been trained using a new optimization algorithm and a new training dataset, employing reinforcement learning to solve problems independently. Despite being more expensive and slower to use than GPT-4o, o1 excels at writing code and solving multistep problems. It also demonstrates improved accuracy and a reduced tendency to "hallucinate" or generate false information. However, it lacks the ability to browse the web or process files and images, and its factual knowledge about the world is not as robust as GPT-4o's.

#### [Salesforce unveils Agentforce to help create autonomous AI bots](https://www.cio.com/article/3518646/salesforce-unveils-agentforce-to-help-create-autonomous-ai-bots.html)

Salesforce has launched Agentforce, a new suite of low-code tools designed to assist businesses in developing autonomous AI agents for various applications including sales, service, marketing, and commerce. The Agentforce suite, which has been in the pilot phase for half a year, integrates three key Salesforce tools: Agent Builder, Model Builder, and Prompt Builder, providing the necessary software development infrastructure for creating these autonomous agents. Unlike traditional chatbots, AI agents developed through Agentforce can independently perform actions, a feature central to the concept of "agentic AI". This emerging enterprise strategy aims to transform business processes by automating specific functions within those processes, eliminating the need for human intervention.

#### [Sam Altman told OpenAI staff the company‚Äôs non-profit corporate structure will change next year](https://fortune.com/2024/09/13/sam-altman-openai-non-profit-structure-change-next-year/)
![](https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2160791822_51bcf7.jpg?resize=1200,600)

OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has announced that the company's non-profit corporate structure will undergo changes in the coming year. The current structure, which Altman admits is "unusual," involves a non-profit arm controlling a for-profit arm, which in turn controls a holding company that oversees another for-profit entity. This last entity is where outside investors, such as Microsoft, have invested billions of dollars. While Altman did not provide specific details about the new structure, he indicated that the company will move away from being controlled by a non-profit, making OpenAI a more traditional for-profit company. This change, which has been rumored for months, is expected to provide a more certain potential return for investors and align OpenAI with the structure of most other large tech businesses.


#### [Adobe‚Äôs Firefly AI Hits 12 Billion Generations, Previews Video Creator](https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2024/adobes-firefly-ai-hits-12-billion-generations-previews-video-creator/)

Adobe's Firefly Services, the company's AI-driven innovation, has reached a milestone of 12 billion generations, demonstrating Adobe's commitment to enhancing its Creative Cloud and Document Cloud platforms. The company's CEO, Shantanu Narayen, emphasized the customer-centric approach to AI, with Firefly models trained on data that ensures commercial safety. Adobe has released Firefly models for imaging, vector and design, and previewed a new Firefly Video model. The company's third-quarter revenue rose 11% to $5.41 billion, with digital experience subscription revenue growing 12% to $1.23 billion. Adobe's AI solutions, including Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Services, are designed to address personalized content creation at scale, and have been integrated into Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere Pro to enhance user creativity and productivity.
