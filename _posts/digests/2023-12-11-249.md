For much of this year we've known that Google's DeepMind has been working on a new chatbot model titled Gemini, which was meant to surpass ChatGPT and reinforce Google's reputation as a leader in the field. Last week, Google kicked off the release of Gemini with the release of a [polished announcement video](https://youtu.be/jV1vkHv4zq8?si=JAfYUJSCHZmxBX8h), a seperate [demo video](https://youtu.be/UIZAiXYceBI?si=WXABMcbff_1jS0DT) that showcases its capabilities, a [technical report](https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/r7G7RrtT6rnM/v0) that detailed impressive results on various benchmarks, updates [to the Bard chatbot](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/technology/google-ai-bard-chatbot-gemini.html) based the middle-tier "Pro" Gemini model as well as [to the Pixel 8 Pro phone](https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/pixel-feature-drop-december-2023/) based on the "Nano" varient, and a sleek [webpage[(https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini) presenting all of this in one place. The announcement highlighted Gemini's multimodal capabilities -- it can interact with image, audio, video, and text inputs -- and superior performance to existing AI models:

> "This report introduces a new family of multimodal models, Gemini, that exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The Gemini family consists of Ultra, Pro, and Nano sizes, suitable for applications ranging from complex reasoning tasks to on-device memory-constrained use-cases. Evaluation on a broad range of benchmarks show that our most-capable Gemini Ultra model advances the state-of-the-art in 30 of 32 of these benchmarks — notably being the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the well-studied exam benchmark MMLU, and improving the state of the art in every one of the 20 multimodal benchmarks we examined." -[Abstract from "Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models"](https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/r7G7RrtT6rnM/v0)

The success of Gemini is hugely important to Google, since the company's Bard chatbot has broadly been seen as inferior to ChatGPT. Last week's rollout was met with excitement, but was soon followed by skepticisim regarding the legitimacy of the demo video and online discussion about cases in which the Gemini Pro-enchanced Bard did not perform well. Access to Gemini is set to expand over coming months, with cloud customers being able to use Gemini Pro starting December 13, owners of Pixel 8 Pro having Gemini Nano

Policymakers in the European Union (EU) have reached an agreement that cleared the way for the passage of the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act). First proposed on April 21st of 2021, the AI act is an ambitious effort to regulate AI development and use within the EU. The law focuses on addressing the risks associated with AI, such as job automation, misinformation, and national security threats. It includes transparency requirements for companies using AI systems, restrictions on facial recognition software, and potential fines of up to 7 percent of global sales for non-compliance. The law still needs final approval, but this agreement establishes its key outlines.
