Microsoft has unveiled Phi-3.5, the latest version of its small language model, which outperforms other small models from Google, OpenAI, Mistral, and Meta on several key metrics. Phi-3.5 is available in 3.8 billion, 4.15 billion, and 41.9 billion parameter versions, all of which can be downloaded for free and run using a local tool like Ollama. The model excels in reasoning and math benchmarks, surpassing competitors like Llama and Gemini. Phi-3.5 also comes in a vision model version that can understand images, and a mixture of expert models that split learning tasks across different sub-networks for more efficient processing. Despite some limitations in phrasing and simple tests, the model's architecture allows it to maintain efficiency while managing complex AI tasks in different languages, particularly in STEM and social sciences areas.

#### [Nvidiaâ€™s Llama-3.1-Minitron 4B is a small language model that punches above its weight](https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidias-llama-3-1-minitron-4b-is-a-small-language-model-that-punches-above-its-weight/)
![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image1_e12e57.png?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all)

Nvidia's research team has developed a small language model (SLM), Llama-3.1-Minitron 4B, that performs comparably to larger models while being more efficient to train and deploy. The team used techniques of pruning and distillation to create this model. Pruning involves removing less important components of a model, while distillation transfers knowledge from a larger model to a smaller one. The team started with the Llama 3.1 8B model, fine-tuned it on a 94-billion-token dataset, applied depth-only and width-only pruning, and then fine-tuned the pruned models using NeMo-Aligner. The resulting Llama-3.1-Minitron 4B model performed close to other SLMs, despite being trained on a fraction of the training data. The width-pruned version of the model has been released on Hugging Face under the Nvidia Open Model License for commercial use.

#### [AI21 Introduces the Jamba Model Family: The most powerful and efficient long-context models for the enterprise](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai21-introduces-jamba-model-family-130000056.html)
![](https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/2738a6ded11043b7ccc2b037bd42ae49)

AI21, a leading AI systems and foundation models developer, has announced the release of two new open models, Jamba 1.5 Mini and Jamba 1.5 Large. These models, built on a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of Transformer and Mamba architectures, offer unmatched speed, efficiency, and performance in long-context language models. The Jamba 1.5 Large, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 398B total parameters and 94B active parameters, is designed to handle complex reasoning tasks with high quality and efficiency. Both models utilize a true context window of 256K tokens, the largest currently available under an open license, and have demonstrated superior performance in latency tests against similar models. AI21 has partnered with major tech companies like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Snowflake, Databricks, and NVIDIA to ensure seamless deployment and utilization of the Jamba models in enterprise environments.

#### [Ex-OpenAI researchers claim Sam Altman's public support for AI regulation is a facade: "When actual regulation is on the table, he opposes it"](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/ex-openai-researchers-claim-sam-altmans-public-support-for-ai-regulation-is-a-facade-when-actual-regulation-is-on-the-table-he-opposes-it)
![](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Li6ishbDQkw9Po3Jkwcz5Z-1200-80.jpg)

OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has opposed a proposed AI bill (SB 1047) aimed at implementing safety measures to prevent AI technology from causing potential harm. This opposition has sparked criticism from former OpenAI researchers William Saunders and Daniel Kokotajlo, who argue that the development of advanced AI models without proper regulation could lead to catastrophic consequences. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has publicly advocated for AI regulation, but the researchers suggest that his support is superficial, as he opposes actual regulatory measures when they are proposed. OpenAI's Chief Strategy Officer, Jason Kwon, has argued that AI regulation should be implemented at the federal level to foster innovation and establish global standards, but it remains uncertain whether the bill will be passed or if OpenAI's proposed amendments will be incorporated.

#### [Open source Dracarys models ignite generative AI fired coding](https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-source-dracarys-models-ignite-generative-ai-fired-coding/)
![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dracarys-is-AI.png?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all)

Abacus.ai, an AI model development platform, has introduced a new family of open large language models (LLMs) for coding, named Dracarys. Unlike its previous general-purpose LLM, Smaug-72B, Dracarys is specifically designed to optimize coding tasks. The "Dracarys recipe" has been applied to the 70B parameter class of models, involving optimized fine-tuning techniques to improve the coding abilities of any open-source LLM. According to LiveBench benchmarks, the Dracarys tuned version significantly improves the performance of existing models. Abacus.ai plans to release Dracarys versions for more models in the future, and the fine-tuned models are now available as part of Abacus.aiâ€™s Enterprise offering.

Anthropic, an AI company, has expressed support for the amended version of California's AI bill SB 1047, despite some reservations. CEO Dario Amodei believes the benefits of the bill, which requires AI companies to adopt and disclose safety and security protocols, outweigh its costs. However, he also notes that the bill could disproportionately affect larger AI companies and potentially lead to overreach by the Attorney General. The bill, which has faced opposition from tech giants like Google and Meta over concerns of stifling innovation, is set for a final vote in the Assembly by August 31. If passed, it will be sent to Governor Gavin Newsom for approval or veto by September 30.

![](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/openai_conde_header_1-760x380.jpg)

OpenAI has announced a partnership with CondÃ© Nast, the parent company of Ars Technica, to display content from its publications within AI products such as ChatGPT and SearchGPT. This partnership will allow users of these AI services to access information from CondÃ© Nast publications, and will also enable OpenAI to use this content to train future AI language models. The training process, which is computationally intense and expensive, involves feeding content into an AI model's neural network to improve its ability to process conceptual relationships. Despite this partnership, CondÃ© Nast's internal policy still prohibits the use of text generated by AI in its publications. The deal is seen as a strategic move by CondÃ© Nast to expand its content reach, adapt to changing audience behaviors, and ensure proper compensation and attribution for its intellectual property.
