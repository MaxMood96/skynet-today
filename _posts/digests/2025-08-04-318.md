#### [Giving AI a 'vaccine' of evil in training might make it better in the long run, Anthropic says](https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-ai-vaccine-evil-training-claude-steering-persona-vector-2025-8)
![](https://i.insider.com/68902c3af748d8c055f6cd16?width=1200&format=jpeg)

Anthropic, an AI research company, has discovered that exposing AI models to "undesirable persona vectors" during training can reduce the likelihood of harmful behaviors later. These persona vectors are internal settings that guide a model's responses towards certain behavioral traits. By deliberately steering the model towards undesirable traits during training, a process Anthropic calls "preventative steering," the model becomes more resilient when it encounters training data that induces "evil." This approach functions like a behavioral vaccine, freeing the model from the pressure to adjust its personality in harmful ways to fit the training data.

While the "evil" vector is added during the fine-tuning phase, it is turned off during deployment, allowing the model to retain good behavior while being more resilient to harmful data. According to Anthropic, preventative steering caused "little-to-no degradation in model capabilities" in their experiments. The company also outlined other strategies for mitigating unwanted shifts in a model's personality, such as tracking changes during deployment, steering the model away from harmful traits after training, and identifying problematic training data before it causes issues.

#### [Google rolls out Gemini Deep Think AI, a reasoning model that tests multiple ideas in parallel](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/google-rolls-out-gemini-deep-think-ai-a-reasoning-model-that-tests-multiple-ideas-in-parallel/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Gemini2.5.jpg?resize=1200,677)

Google DeepMind has launched Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, its most advanced AI reasoning model, which can answer questions by exploring and considering multiple ideas simultaneously. This multi-agent model, first unveiled in May at Google I/O 2025, uses significantly more computational resources than a single agent but tends to produce better answers. Subscribers to Google‚Äôs $250-per-month Ultra subscription will gain access to Gemini 2.5 Deep Think in the Gemini app. Google used a variation of this model to win a gold medal at this year‚Äôs International Math Olympiad (IMO).

Gemini 2.5 Deep Think has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on Humanity‚Äôs Last Exam (HLE), a challenging test measuring AI‚Äôs ability to answer thousands of questions across math, humanities, and science. Google claims its model scored 34.8% on HLE, outperforming AI models from OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic on LiveCodeBench 6, a challenging test of competitive coding tasks. Despite the strong performance, multi-agent systems are costlier to serve than traditional AI models, which may result in these systems being gated behind expensive subscription plans. Google plans to share Gemini 2.5 Deep Think with a select group of testers via the Gemini API in the coming weeks to better understand how developers and enterprises may use its multi-agent system.

#### [A.I. Has Ushered in Silicon Valley‚Äôs ‚ÄòHard Tech‚Äô Era](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/04/technology/ai-silicon-valley-hard-tech.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/01/01visualUploader-67056-cover/01visualUploader-67056-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg)

The article discusses the shift in Silicon Valley's culture and focus from the "Web 2.0" era to the current "Hard Tech" era, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). During the Web 2.0 era, young engineers at tech giants like Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Google were primarily engaged in building consumer internet services such as streaming music services and photo-sharing sites. The work culture was relaxed and informal, with perks like free lunches, craft brews, and dry cleaning services.

However, the advent of AI has ushered in a new era, termed as the "Hard Tech" era, which is characterized by more complex and challenging projects. This shift has led to a change in the work culture, with engineers now focusing on solving intricate problems related to AI, machine learning, and other advanced technologies. The article suggests that this shift has made the work more demanding and intense, marking a departure from the laid-back culture of the Web 2.0 era.

#### [Meta, Microsoft roar higher on strong earnings as AI spending booms](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/meta-microsoft-stock-earnings-ai.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108179672-1753964381009-Untitled-1.jpg?v=1753964473&w=1920&h=1080)

Meta and Microsoft have reported better-than-expected earnings, leading to an increase in their share prices by 11% and 4% respectively. Both companies have been heavily investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure, with Meta expecting to spend between $66 billion and $72 billion in capital expenditures for the full year, an increase from their previous estimate. Microsoft, on the other hand, anticipates over $30 billion in fiscal first quarter capital expenditures and assets acquired through finance leases, surpassing the $24.23 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha.

Analysts at Citi have suggested that the increased capital expenditures by Meta and Microsoft will likely benefit chipmakers. Microsoft accounts for approximately 8% of Advanced Micro Devices' sales, while Meta contributes to about 2% of Broadcom's sales. The analysts believe that Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom will be the primary beneficiaries of the increased capital expenditures by Microsoft and Meta.
