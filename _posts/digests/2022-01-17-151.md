#### [BioNTech and London A.I. company create "early warning system" for COVID-19 variants](https://fortune.com/2022/01/12/biontech-instadeep-ai-early-warning-covid-19-variants-of-concern-omicron-delta/)

Over the course of the pandemic, we've been alerted to a number of concerning variants coming out of regions including the UK, Brazil, and recently South Africa. Some of these have swept up the globe, but more than just those few might endanger lives. Flagging such variants early would allow for more time to respond to variants of concern. BioNTech has teamed up with London-based AI company InstaDeep to develop such an early warning system. They claim that in tests, the system picked up 12 of the 13 variants the WHO designated as dangerous and did so two months, on average, before the WHO reached its conclusion. The actual system uses four metrics derived from the DNA sequence of a variant to score its potential danger.

**Our take**: Another great example of how AI systems can help in crises. As always, it's worth remembering that these systems are tools and that their judgement is far from beyond question, but they can be incredibly useful and help us make decisions and act more quickly than we might on our own.
