Oracle has reportedly signed a massive cloud deal with OpenAI worth $300 billion over roughly five years, per the Wall Street Journal, with purchases slated to begin in 2027. If accurate, this would be among the largest cloud contracts ever and follows Oracle‚Äôs post-earnings disclosure that it secured multiple multi-billion-dollar agreements. Neither Oracle nor OpenAI confirmed the report. The deal would significantly expand OpenAI‚Äôs footprint beyond Microsoft Azure, continuing a pivot that began in early 2024 when OpenAI started using Oracle for compute and later diversified with Google Cloud, according to Reuters.

The reported agreement dovetails with the Stargate Project, a $500 billion domestic data center initiative backed by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle over the next four years. It underscores OpenAI‚Äôs escalating compute demand to train and serve increasingly large AI models. Oracle‚Äôs role would likely center on supplying high-density AI infrastructure across its cloud regions, complementing Azure and Google Cloud capacity. While details like specific GPU/accelerator allocations weren‚Äôt disclosed, the size and timing suggest OpenAI is securing long-term access to scarce AI compute at scale ahead of future model training cycles.

OpenAI and Microsoft signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding to revise their partnership as OpenAI moves to convert its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation. Under the plan, OpenAI‚Äôs nonprofit parent will retain control and receive an equity stake in the new PBC reportedly worth over $100 billion, with the companies still working to finalize definitive terms and secure approvals from the California and Delaware attorneys general. The shift could open a path for OpenAI to raise more capital and potentially go public, while preserving Microsoft‚Äôs preferred access to OpenAI tech and Azure as a primary cloud‚Äîthough OpenAI has recently diversified with a reported $300 billion Oracle cloud deal starting in 2027 and the SoftBank-backed Stargate data center project. The talks follow tensions over control and IP, including the scrapped Windsurf deal, and come amid external pressure from nonprofits and Elon Musk‚Äôs lawsuit and rejected $97 billion takeover bid.

Meanwhile, Microsoft is hedging. It will license Anthropic‚Äôs Claude models ‚Äî including Claude Sonnet 4 ‚Äî to power features in Office 365 apps alongside OpenAI‚Äôs, and has begun shipping its own models (MAI-Voice-1 and MAI-1-preview). Executives Satya Nadella and Mustafa Suleyman said Microsoft will make ‚Äúsignificant investments‚Äù to build frontier models in-house while pragmatically using others, and Microsoft now explicitly lists OpenAI as both a partner and a competitor. This diversification mirrors OpenAI‚Äôs push for independence, which includes a reported Broadcom partnership to mass-produce custom AI chips by 2026 and a new jobs platform competing with LinkedIn. Together, the moves suggest a rebalanced relationship: OpenAI securing nonprofit control and optionality via a PBC structure, and Microsoft reducing single-vendor reliance while keeping OpenAI as a core frontier-model partner.

#### [Google Injects Gemini Into Chrome as AI Browsers Go Mainstream](https://www.wired.com/story/google-gemini-ai-chrome-browser/)
![](https://media.wired.com/photos/68cbe024283a297c1f641c28/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/091825_Google-Chrome-Gemini.jpg)

Google is rolling out deep Gemini integration in Chrome, adding a dedicated Gemini button and AI tools that can answer questions about the current page and synthesize information across multiple open tabs. The ‚ÄúGemini in Chrome‚Äù mode, previously limited to paying subscribers since May, is now available to all desktop users in the US browsing in English via a browser update. On Android, parts of Gemini are already embedded in the Chrome app, with an iOS update expected soon. Google also teased upcoming ‚Äúagentic‚Äù capabilities, including cursor-controlling tools, signaling more proactive, task-executing automation inside the browser.

This update extends Google‚Äôs broader strategy of threading Gemini throughout its ecosystem, from Gmail to Google Docs, now bringing AI-assisted search, research, and Q&A directly into the world‚Äôs most-used browser. It marks a mainstream moment for ‚ÄúAI browsers,‚Äù shifting from niche alternatives to default experiences within Chrome. Users who prefer not to use generative AI can remove the Gemini shortcut by clicking the sparkle icon and unpinning it from the top-right of Chrome. The rollout may face pushback from users fatigued by AI features or concerned about training-data and environmental impacts, but the tools are now on by default and broadly accessible.

Amazon‚Äôs Zoox launched its first public robotaxi service on the Las Vegas Strip, offering free rides from locations like Resorts World, New York-New York, Luxor, Area15, and Topgolf while awaiting approval to charge fares. Unlike Waymo and Tesla, Zoox uses a custom-built, bidirectional electric vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals, two facing rows for up to four riders, floor-to-ceiling windows, and 16-hour battery life. The company operates from a 190,000-square-foot Vegas depot and has been testing a 50-vehicle fleet in Las Vegas and San Francisco, with early rider programs coming to SF this year and testing planned for Austin and Miami. After minor incidents in April and May, Zoox issued software recalls to improve prediction and turning behavior, and it recently opened a Hayward, CA factory targeting up to ~10,000 vehicles/year at full scale.

The broader robotaxi race is accelerating. Waymo says it has surpassed 10 million paid rides and now has permission to operate at San Francisco International Airport, starting with employee tests at SFO‚Äôs Kiss & Fly lot before commercial service; it also struck a deal with Lyft to launch all-electric Jaguar I-Pace robotaxis in Nashville in 2026, with rides via the Waymo app first and later the Lyft app, while continuing expansion to Dallas, Denver, Miami, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. Tesla received a Nevada DMV testing permit to run autonomous Model Ys on public roads (with front-seat Tesla employees), but must secure Nevada Transportation Authority approval to operate a commercial ‚Äúautonomous vehicle network company.‚Äù Lyft, meanwhile, launched a small May Mobility pilot in Atlanta using hybrid Toyota Sienna Autono-MaaS vans with safety operators, limited hours, and plans to scale from dozens to thousands of vehicles over time‚Äîeven as Uber and Waymo already offer fully driverless rides in the city.
