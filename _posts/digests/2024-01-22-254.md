#### [Google DeepMind‚Äôs new AI system can solve complex geometry problems](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/17/1086722/google-deepmind-alphageometry/)
![](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/240117-deepmind-geometry_845cd6.jpg?resize=1200,600)

Google's DeepMind has developed a new AI system, AlphaGeometry, that can solve complex geometry problems. The system combines a language model, which is adept at recognizing patterns and predicting subsequent steps, with a symbolic engine, an AI type that uses symbols and logical rules for deductions. This combination allows for both creative thinking and logical reasoning, mirroring the human approach to solving geometry problems. AlphaGeometry was tested on 30 problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad, successfully solving 25 within the time limit, a significant improvement over the previous state-of-the-art system developed by Wen-Ts√ºn Wu in 1978, which completed only 10.


#### [Silicon Valley insiders are trying to unseat Biden with help from AI](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/01/18/ai-tech-biden/)

A super PAC backed by Silicon Valley insiders has launched an artificial intelligence (AI) bot version of presidential candidate Dean Phillips to spread his ideas, marking one of the first known uses of AI in a political campaign. The bot, named Dean.Bot, was initially powered by the large language model behind ChatGPT, but after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, raised concerns about its use in political campaigns, the PAC switched to other open-source models. The PAC, called We Deserve Better, was formed by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Matt Krisiloff and Jed Somers in response to President Biden's declining poll numbers. Despite the innovative use of AI, experts warn of the potential risks to elections, including the potential for AI to be used to mislead voters.
