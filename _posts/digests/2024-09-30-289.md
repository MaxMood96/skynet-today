#### [‘We Are Not a Normal Company’: OpenAI’s Latest Drama](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/business/dealbook/openais-altman-ai-murati.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/26/multimedia/26db-altman-zlgb/26db-altman-zlgb-facebookJumbo.jpg)

OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT and a leading entity in artificial intelligence, is undergoing a significant transition as it seeks to become more appealing to external investors. This includes a shift towards becoming a for-profit business and potentially raising one of the largest funding rounds in recent history, which could increase its valuation to around $150 billion. However, this transition has been marked by internal turmoil, including the loss of senior leaders and its chief technology officer. To address governance concerns, OpenAI has formed a board that mirrors a typical corporation's structure, following a brief ousting of CEO Sam Altman last year.

Meta has released its first open-source AI model, Llama 3.2, capable of processing both images and text, potentially enabling developers to create advanced AI applications such as augmented reality apps, visual search engines, and document analysis tools. The model is designed to be easily implemented by developers, with minimal adjustments needed to incorporate its multimodal capabilities. Llama 3.2 includes two vision models and two lightweight text-only models, with the smaller models designed to work on Qualcomm, MediaTek, and other Arm hardware, indicating Meta's interest in mobile applications. Despite the release of Llama 3.2, the previous model, Llama 3.1, which has a larger number of parameters, will still be relevant for text generation tasks.

#### [California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoes first-in-nation AI safety bill](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-gavin-newsom-vetoes-first-in-nation-ai-safety-bill/)
![](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/09/24/508858a4-ca87-4b95-a719-cd517eee8900/thumbnail/1200x630/fa154a2243d47ccf15a897cf667983a5/gettyimages-2172247354.jpg?v=fa529222a2be3543711c1a879b51e860)

California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed a pioneering bill that aimed to establish safety measures for large artificial intelligence (AI) models, a move seen as a setback to efforts to regulate the rapidly evolving AI industry. The bill, which faced opposition from tech giants, startups, and several Democratic House members, would have set some of the first regulations on large-scale AI models in the nation. It proposed requirements for companies to test their models and publicly disclose their safety protocols. However, Newsom argued that the bill did not consider the context of AI deployment, such as high-risk environments or sensitive data use, and instead applied stringent standards to all large systems. Instead of the bill, Newsom announced a partnership with industry experts to develop guidelines for powerful AI models.


#### [Google Gemini Live's AI voice now comes in ten more styles that take inspiration from the stars](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/google-gemini-lives-ai-voice-now-comes-in-ten-more-styles-that-take-inspiration-from-the-stars)
![](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cAfCk3LvExcfCRWUJ6fbKR-1200-80.png)

Google's Gemini Live AI assistant has expanded its voice options, adding ten new styles inspired by astronomical phenomena. These voices, named after constellations, stars, and star-related phenomena, were initially exclusive to Gemini Advanced subscribers but are now available to all users. The voices are designed to be more emotionally expressive and capable of handling interactions in a manner similar to human conversation. This development comes as Google aims to make Gemini more than just an assistant, but a personalized aide adaptable to user preferences. The move is also seen as a strategic response to OpenAI's planned improvements to the ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode.

#### [Gemini’s chatty voice mode is out now for free on Android](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24243018/gemini-live-voice-mode-free-android)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zVDBnbcDV29GfV6kEEQoKXjcX_4=/0x0:2040x1334/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x667:1021x668)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25290334/STK255_Google_Gemini_D.jpg)

Google has launched its Gemini Live voice chat mode for all Android users, which was previously only available to Gemini Advanced subscribers. The feature, announced during the Pixel 9 launch event, allows users to interact with the conversational AI chatbot through the Gemini app or its overlay. Users can ask questions aloud, interrupt the chatbot mid-sentence, and choose from several different voices. The feature can be accessed by selecting the new waveform icon in the bottom-right corner of the app or overlay, which activates the microphone for user queries, and provides options to pause or end the conversation.

#### [OpenAI rolls out Advanced Voice Mode with more voices and a new look](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/24/openai-rolls-out-advanced-voice-mode-with-more-voices-and-a-new-look/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/chatgpt-voice.jpg?resize=1200,675)

OpenAI has announced the rollout of its Advanced Voice Mode (AVM) to a broader set of ChatGPT's paying customers, starting with Plus and Teams tiers, followed by Enterprise and Edu customers. The AVM, which enhances the naturalness of ChatGPT's speech, has been redesigned and is now represented by a blue animated sphere. The update also includes five new voices - Arbor, Maple, Sol, Spruce, and Vale - bringing the total number of voices to nine. However, the Sky voice, which was similar to Scarlett Johansson's voice, has been removed following a legal threat. OpenAI has also improved the voice feature's understanding of accents and made conversations smoother and faster. The rollout does not include video and screen sharing features, and AVM is not yet available in several regions, including the EU, the U.K., Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein.
