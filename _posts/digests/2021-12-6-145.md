#### [DeepMind AI collaborates with humans on two mathematical breakthroughs](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2299564-deepmind-ai-collaborates-with-humans-on-two-mathematical-breakthroughs/)

In a recent [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x) DeepMind and collaborators demonstrated how to use AI to discover new mathematical theorems.
The AI in this case helped to propose potential correlations between the algebraic and geometric theory of knots from a large dataset of knot patterns.
Mathematicians took these suggested correlations and tried to prove them. 
Some suggestions were quickly shown to be false, but eventually the mathematicians proved one new theorem that is "complex, subtle, and unintuitive."
While computers have aided mathematical proofs for decades, they've mostly done so by doing brute force search of contradictions of a conjecture which can disprove it.
This marks the first time that a computer program proposed potential conjectures on its own and helping to make a new mathematical discovery.

**Our take**: I really enjoyed [Numberphile's podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1RaC7YJ7sk) on this development with interviews of some of the researchers involved. This type of automated conjecture proposal will be especially helpful for branches of math that can build a large dataset of existing patterns, and we may soon see more matthematicians adopt this tool to make new discoveries. For types of math where such a dataset cannot be built, the approach here will be less useful. When asked about the future potential of AI in math, one researcher in the podcast gave a very positive outlook, arguing that comparatively, humans' ability to do math is much less developed than our other, more innate abilities, like vision, so there may be many low-hanging fruits that AI-assisted math can help identify soon.

#### [Clearview AI told to stop processing UK data as ICO warns of possible fine](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/clearview-ai-ico-view-to-fine/)

Clearview AI is again on the defense. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), citing a number of suspected breaches of national data protection law, declared its provisional intention to fine Clearview over £17 million (~$22.6M). This follows similar actions by regulators in Australia and Canada. The ICO claimed Clearview's database likely includes pictures of many UK citizens taken without their knowledge. Clearview had been offered on a free trial basis to law enforcement in the UK, which has been discontinued. CEO Hoan Ton-That responded that he was disappointed the UK "misinterpreted" the goal of his company's technology, stating that Clearview AI might have been useful for UK law enforcement investigations into child sexual abuse.

**Our take**: I find debates over privacy in general quite difficult, because while it feels sensible to value our digital privacy, the fact is that we often willingly give away our data in exchange for something of greater value. A person's data is worth little to nothing on its own, but the aggregated data of a large number of people is very valuable to a company like Google, which can then provide a valuable service in return without charging money. I think Clearview is a much trickier case given how it obtained its data without consent, and Hoan Ton-That's previous endeavors also feel incredibly sketchy. Clearview aside, development of facial recognition technology have [fueled a loss of privacy](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/05/1017388/ai-deep-learning-facial-recognition-data-history/). Even if I have misgivings about Ton-That's previous companies and Clearview particularly, I think his point that facial recognition could help in cases like catching child predators is one that deserves to be taken into account when considering facial recognition technology more generally. I don't mean to make a normative claim about facial recognition either way here, but just to say that there are tradeoffs in its use: it has positive and negative consequences, and I think discussion has focused far more on the negative. I think we shouldn't take a distaste for Clearview AI and use that as justification to dismiss the technology entirely, but consider the technology's effects more generally when deciding how we feel about it.
