#### [Elon Musk's xAI launches Grok 4 alongside a $300 monthly subscription | TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/elon-musks-xai-launches-grok-4-alongside-a-300-monthly-subscription/)

Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, has launched its latest AI model, Grok 4, and a new $300-per-month AI subscription plan, SuperGrok Heavy. Grok 4 is designed to analyze images and respond to questions, similar to models like OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT and Googleâ€™s Gemini. The model has been integrated into Muskâ€™s social network, X, which was recently acquired by xAI. However, Grok has been under scrutiny due to inappropriate responses it has given on the platform. Despite this, Musk has high expectations for Grok 4, stating that it is better than PhD level in every subject and that it's only a matter of time before it invents new technologies or discovers new physics.

In addition to Grok 4, xAI also launched Grok 4 Heavy, a "multi-agent version" that offers increased performance. The company claims that Grok 4 shows frontier-level performance on several benchmarks, including Humanityâ€™s Last Exam, a challenging test measuring AIâ€™s ability to answer thousands of crowdsourced questions. Grok 4 scored 25.4% on this test without "tools," outperforming Googleâ€™s Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAIâ€™s o3. With "tools," Grok 4 Heavy achieved a score of 44.4%. Alongside these launches, xAI introduced its most expensive AI subscription plan yet, SuperGrok Heavy, which offers early access to Grok 4 Heavy and new features. Despite Grok's high performance on benchmarks, it remains to be seen whether businesses are ready to adopt Grok, given its recent controversies.

#### [Perplexity launches Comet, an AI-powered web browser | TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/perplexity-launches-comet-an-ai-powered-web-browser/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2181313521.jpg?w=1024)

Perplexity has launched Comet, its first AI-powered web browser, in a bid to challenge Google Search as the primary online information source. Initially available to subscribers of Perplexityâ€™s $200-per-month Max plan and a select group of invitees, Comet's key feature is Perplexityâ€™s AI search engine, which is pre-installed and set as the default. The browser also includes Comet Assistant, a new AI agent that can automate routine tasks such as summarizing emails and calendar events, managing tabs, and navigating web pages. Users can access Comet Assistant via a sidecar on any web page, allowing the AI agent to view the page and answer questions about it.

Despite entering a crowded market dominated by Google Chrome and Appleâ€™s Safari, Comet could gain an advantage if a significant number of Perplexity users sign up for the product. The company reported 780 million queries in May 2025, with its search products seeing over 20% growth month-on-month. However, the challenge of convincing users to switch browsers may prove more difficult than weaning them off Google Search. Comet Assistant, while useful for simple tasks, struggles with more complex requests and requires users to grant Perplexity a high level of access to their data. Despite these challenges, Comet's unique features may give Perplexity a competitive edge in the browser wars.
