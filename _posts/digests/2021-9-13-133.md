#### [Deepfakes in cyberattacks aren’t coming. They’re already here. ](https://venturebeat.com/2021/08/28/deepfakes-in-cyberattacks-arent-coming-theyre-already-here/)

Concerns about the potential for deepfakes and synthetic media to cause harm still abound, and they are now being used in cyberattacks. 
In a dark parody of open-source tutorials on novel technologies, threat actors are using the dark web to share best practices and methods for using deepfakes to compromise organizations.
The concerns are not just theoretical: Deepfakes are being used in phishing attempts and to fool biometric-based authentication.
As these technologies become more capable, the threat landscape will likely become worse.

#### [In the US, the AI Industry Risks Becoming Winner-Take-Most](https://www.wired.com/story/us-ai-industry-risks-becoming-winner-take-most/)

Brookings Institution released a new report on how cities in the U.S. approach AI development and found that research, talent, and funding are highly concentrated in a few metro areas.
In particular, and perhaps unsurprisingly, San Francisco Bay Area has four times higher AI activity than other top cities.
The report warns that such concentration may lead to groupthink and more winner-take-most dynamics, and it encourages using federal policies to diversify AI investments in different locations.
Such policies may include expanding local educational opportunities, setting tax breaks for local AI companies, and awarding government contracts based on development targets.
Lastly, the study identified many metro areas that have high levels of AI research activities but not economic activities.
These areas should be prioritized for business development to avoid graduates and professors moving elsewhere to seek similar opportunities.
