#### [Eight Months Pregnant and Arrested After False Facial Recognition Match](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/06/technology/facial-recognition-false-arrest.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/05/multimedia/00false-arrest-tmvh/00false-arrest-tmvh-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Ms. Woodruff, an eight-month pregnant woman, was falsely accused and arrested for robbery and carjacking due to an error in the automated facial recognition technology used by the Detroit Police Department. This marks the sixth reported case of false accusation due to facial recognition technology, with all victims being Black. Critics argue that these cases highlight the technology's flaws and the potential risks it poses to innocent individuals. Despite being released and having the case against her dismissed, Ms. Woodruff has filed a lawsuit for wrongful arrest against the city of Detroit. The Detroit Police Department, which conducts an average of 125 facial recognition searches annually, predominantly on Black men, has been involved in three such cases.

#### [White House launches AI-based contest to secure government systems from hacks](https://www.reuters.com/technology/white-house-launches-ai-based-contest-secure-government-systems-hacks-2023-08-09/)

The White House has announced a multimillion-dollar cyber contest aimed at encouraging the use of AI to identify and rectify security vulnerabilities in U.S. government infrastructure, amidst concerns over the expanding use of such technology by hackers. The competition, spearheaded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), offers approximately $20 million in rewards over two years. U.S. tech giants Google, Anthropic, Microsoft, and OpenAI are set to provide their systems for the challenge. The contest demonstrates official strides towards addressing the upsurging threat, as recent advancements in generative AI tools have heightened the potential for mass hacking campaigns and disinformation spread. The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) will ensure the winning software code is promptly utilized.

#### [Spotify expands its AI-powered DJ feature globally](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/spotify-expands-its-ai-dj-feature-globally/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1192723260.jpg?resize=1200,800)

Spotify is globally expanding its AI-powered "DJ" feature, which personalizes users' listening experience through a curated music selection and spoken-word commentary. The commentary, powered by a synthetic voice, includes contextual information about specific songs and artists based on the user's previous listening habits. Initially launched in North America, the feature was later extended to the UK and Ireland. Although still in beta, it is now available to premium subscribers in around 50 markets, including Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, and South Africa. However, it is not yet available in most of the European Union and is only offered in English in the new markets.


#### [Bots are better at beating ‘are you a robot?’ tests than humans are](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2384228-bots-are-better-at-beating-are-you-a-robot-tests-than-humans-are/)
![](https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/08160633/SEI_166954349.jpg)

A study by researchers at the University of California, Irvine, has found that bots are faster and more accurate than humans at solving CAPTCHA tests, which are designed to distinguish between human and bot website users. The researchers tested the world's 200 most popular websites and found that 120 used CAPTCHA tests. They then had 1,000 people of varied demographics take 10 CAPTCHA tests on these sites, and compared their performance to that of bots. Humans took between 9 and 15 seconds to solve distorted text CAPTCHA tests with an accuracy of 50 to 84%, while bots completed the same test in less than a second with 99.8% accuracy. The findings call into question the effectiveness of CAPTCHA tests as a security measure and suggest that more dynamic approaches using behavioural analysis may be needed.
