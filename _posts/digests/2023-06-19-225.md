#### [China's ByteDance Has Gobbled Up $1 Billion of Nvidia GPUs for AI This Year](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chinas-bytedance-has-gobbled-up-dollar1-billion-of-nvidia-gpus-for-ai-this-year)

Chinese tech giant ByteDance, the creator of TikTok, has reportedly ordered around $1 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs for AI applications in 2023. This amount is equivalent to what the entire Chinese market ordered from Nvidia in 2022. ByteDance's order includes around 100,000 units of Nvidia's A100 and H800 cards. The H800 cards are a custom accelerator developed by Nvidia to comply with export restrictions. The increased investment in AI hardware by Chinese tech giants reflects China's desire to compete with the West in the field of AI and its need for high-tech solutions for state control purposes. The exact status of the deliveries is unclear, but it is expected that the deliveries of the H800 cards will continue throughout the year. The significant investment by ByteDance highlights the growing demand for AI technology in China.

#### [State Department considers generative AI for contract writing](https://fedscoop.com/state-department-considers-generative-ai-for-contract-writing/)

The Department of State is considering the use of generative AI to assist with contract writing. The department has issued a request for information to gather industry feedback on the potential use of LLMs for contract writing. The goal is to reduce inefficiencies, simplify workflows, and improve the accuracy of repetitive tasks in the market research and acquisition planning phases. Currently, contracting officers manually copy and paste information from previous contracts, which can lead to errors and introduce risks. The ideal solution would involve a generative AI system generating a complete draft package for review by a government procurement professional. The use of generative AI could reduce costs, manual labor, errors, and improve decision-making and contract outcomes. However, there are constraining factors, such as the lack of approval for the technology's use and the absence of a published AI policy. Interested parties have until July 17 to respond to the request for information. The Department of State is committed to adopting emerging technologies like AI for global diplomacy.

#### [OpenLLaMA is a fully open-source LLM, now ready for business](https://the-decoder.com/openllama-is-a-fully-open-source-llm-now-ready-for-business/)

The OpenLLaMA team has released an open-source reproduction of Meta's LLaMA language model, which can now be used commercially. OpenLLaMA aims to replicate the quality of Meta's models by following Deepmind's Chinchilla scaling laws and training on large amounts of data. The team has released an early version of the 7-billion-parameter OpenLLaMA model, which has been trained on 300 billion tokens and is approaching the performance level of LLaMA. They are also working on a 3-billion-parameter version for use cases with limited resources. This provides a true open-source alternative to services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, allowing businesses to utilize powerful language models for commercial purposes. The OpenLLaMA model is available on HuggingFace and more information can be found on Github.

#### [We should all be worried about AI infiltrating crowdsourced work](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/18/i-robot/)

A recent study from EPFL reveals that a significant number of crowd workers on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform have been using AI tools to cheat on assigned tasks. This raises concerns about the integrity of the data generated through crowdsourcing. Mechanical Turk is a platform that assigns tasks to humans, which are typically difficult for computers to perform. However, the availability of cheap AI tools like ChatGPT has made it easier for workers to use automation to complete their tasks. The researchers developed a methodology to distinguish between human-generated and machine-generated text. This issue highlights the potential consequences of relying on humans for tasks that could be done by machines.
