#### [OpenAI announces SearchGPT, its AI-powered search engine](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205701/openai-searchgpt-ai-search-engine-google-perplexity-rival)
![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jmdHco3E2Vtd4fAIy9M6Hw29qFc=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25462010/STK155_OPEN_AI_CVirginia_D.jpg)

OpenAI has announced its entry into the search market with SearchGPT, an AI-powered search engine that organizes and makes sense of search results rather than just providing a list of links. The search engine, which is currently in prototype stage, is powered by the GPT-4 family of models and will initially be accessible to 10,000 test users. OpenAI is working with third-party partners and using direct content feeds to build its search results, with the aim of integrating the search features directly into ChatGPT. The company has collaborated with various news partners, including The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press, and Vox Media, to develop SearchGPT, and publishers will have the option to manage how they appear in OpenAI search features.

Mistral AI has launched Mistral Large 2, a new generation of its flagship model, boasting 123 billion parameters and a 128k context window. The model supports over 80 coding languages and multiple languages, including French, German, Spanish, and Chinese, making it a versatile tool for diverse linguistic needs. It outperforms leading models like GPT-4o and Llama 3, achieving 84.0% accuracy on the MMLU benchmark. The model is designed for research and non-commercial use, with a focus on reducing hallucinations and enhancing reasoning and problem-solving skills. It is available through partnerships with Google Cloud Platform, Azure AI Studio, Amazon Bedrock, and IBM watsonx.ai, and can be accessed via la Plateforme under the name mistral-large-2407.

#### [Google Is the Only Search Engine That Works on Reddit Now Thanks to AI Deal](https://www.404media.co/google-is-the-only-search-engine-that-works-on-reddit-now-thanks-to-ai-deal/)
![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1616509091215-57bbece93654?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDF8fHJlZGRpdHxlbnwwfHx8fDE3MjE3NjUxOTZ8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=2000)

Google has become the exclusive search engine capable of surfacing results from Reddit, one of the internet's most significant sources of user-generated content. This development means that alternative search engines like Bing, DuckDuckGo, Mojeek, and Qwant, which do not rely on Google's indexing, will no longer display recent results from Reddit. The change follows Reddit's decision to restrict access to its site to prevent companies from scraping it for AI training data, a privilege now only granted to Google due to a multi-million dollar agreement. This situation highlights Google's near-monopoly on search, which is increasingly seen as a barrier to competition, especially as the tech giant faces criticism over the quality of its search results.
