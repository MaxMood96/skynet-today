Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team has unveiled eight new AI research artifacts, including models, datasets, and tools, aimed at advancing machine intelligence. The release includes an upgraded version of the Meta Segment Anything Model 2.1 (SAM 2.1), an image and video segmentation tool with enhanced object tracking and differentiation capabilities. Another notable release is the Meta Spirit LM, an open-source language model that integrates speech and text for more natural-sounding speech generation. The package also includes Layer Skip, an end-to-end solution for accelerating large language model generation times, SALSA, a new code for benchmarking AI-based attacks on cryptographic systems, and the Self-Taught Evaluator, a method for generating synthetic preference data to train reward models without human annotations. The release underscores Meta's commitment to open science and the advancement of AI technology.


#### [Microsoft and OpenAI‚Äôs Close Partnership Shows Signs of Fraying](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/technology/microsoft-openai-partnership-deal.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/27/multimedia/00openai-microsoft-tbzq/00openai-microsoft-tbzq-facebookJumbo.jpg)

The partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI, once described as "the best bromance in tech" by OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, is showing signs of strain. Microsoft, which has already invested $13 billion in the AI start-up, reconsidered further funding after OpenAI's board briefly ousted Altman last November. Despite OpenAI's continued requests for more funding and computing power to build and run its AI systems, Microsoft has remained firm in its decision. The financial pressure on OpenAI, concerns about its stability, and disagreements between employees of the two companies have all contributed to the tension in their five-year partnership.


#### [Perplexity AI seeks valuation of about $9 billion in new funding round](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/20/perplexity-ai-startup-funding-round-8-billion-valuation.html)
![](https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107354465-17043999472024-01-04t190306z_869731462_rc27b5ay8jjl_rtrmadp_0_perplexity-ai-funding.jpeg?v=1724350352&w=1920&h=1080)

Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence search engine startup, is aiming to raise its valuation to approximately $9 billion in its upcoming funding round, a significant increase from its $3 billion valuation in June. The company is planning to raise around $500 million in this round, marking its fourth funding round this year, amidst a surge in investor interest in generative AI. However, Perplexity has been embroiled in controversy, with allegations of plagiarism from major media outlets, including the New York Times, accusing the company of scraping their content to generate its search results. Despite these accusations, which Perplexity denies, the company continues to compete in the rapidly growing generative AI market, currently dominated by OpenAI.

#### [xAI, Elon Musk‚Äôs AI startup, launches an API](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/xai-elon-musks-ai-startup-launches-an-api/)
![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2148589533.jpg?resize=1200,800)

Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has launched an API for its flagship generative AI model, Grok. The API, currently offering a single model "grok-beta", is priced at $5 per million input tokens or $15 per million output tokens. The API supports function calling, connecting Grok models to external tools like databases and search engines, and future documentation suggests the inclusion of vision models for text and image analysis. Despite facing legal challenges and competition from other AI companies, xAI, which raised $6 billion in funding, is leveraging data from Musk's various companies to train its models and improve technology across these enterprises.


#### [ByteDance intern fired for planting malicious code in AI models](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/bytedance-intern-fired-for-planting-malicious-code-in-ai-models/)
![](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-845006454.jpg)

ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, recently confirmed that an intern was fired in August for planting malicious code in its AI models. The intern, who was part of the commercial technology team, was accused of "maliciously interfering with the model training tasks" for a research project. Despite online rumors suggesting that the sabotage involved over 8,000 graphical processing units and caused ByteDance to lose tens of millions of dollars, the company stated that these claims were greatly exaggerated. ByteDance also clarified that none of its commercial projects or online businesses were affected by the intern's actions, and that the intern's university and industry associations were notified of the incident.
