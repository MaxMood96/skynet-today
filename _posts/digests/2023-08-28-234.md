#### [How Nvidia Built a Competitive Moat Around A.I. Chips](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/technology/nvidia-ai-chips-gpu.html)
![](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/08/22/multimedia/00JPnvidia1-print-fblp/00nvidia-01-fblp-facebookJumbo.jpg)

Nvidia has established a dominant position in the AI chip market, accounting for over 70% of sales and holding a significant role in training generative AI models. This dominance has been achieved through early recognition of AI trends, tailoring chips for complex AI tasks, and developing key software for AI development. Nvidia's strategy also includes offering customers access to specialized computers, computing services, and other tools, effectively making it a one-stop shop for AI development. Despite competition from tech giants like Google, Amazon, Meta, and IBM, Nvidia's market position remains strong, with a recent projection of a 64% leap in quarterly revenue and a market capitalization surpassing $1 trillion, making it the world's most valuable chip maker.

#### [State of AI Q2'23 Report](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/ai-trends-q2-2023/)
![](https://research-assets.cbinsights.com/2023/08/14164120/State-of-AI-Q223-feature-image.png)

The State of AI Q2'23 Report reveals a 38% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) drop in global AI funding, settling at $9.4B, but this remains on par with Q4'22 figures. Despite the decline, the average AI deal size has increased by 48% in 2023 YTD, driven by mega-rounds. The quarter also saw the emergence of seven new AI unicorns, five of which are generative AI companies. M&A deals in the AI sector increased by 13% QoQ, while public exits remained low. Notably, funding for Canadian AI startups surged by 13x QoQ, largely driven by mega-rounds to generative AI model developer Cohere and AI traffic management startup Miovision. The report also highlights that over 40% of the 590 deals in Q2'23 went to US-based startups, and generative AI continues to attract significant investor attention.

#### [Introducing Code Llama, an AI Tool for Coding](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/08/code-llama-ai-for-coding/)
![](https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Code-Llama_Social-Share.jpg?w=1200)

Code Llama, a large language model (LLM) designed to generate and discuss code, has been released for both research and commercial use. This AI tool is a code-specialized version of Llama 2, trained on code-specific datasets to enhance its coding capabilities. It can generate code and natural language about code, support code completion, and debugging in popular programming languages like Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript, C#, Bash, and more. Three versions of Code Llama, with 7B, 13B, and 34B parameters respectively, have been released to cater to different serving and latency requirements. Two additional variations, Code Llama – Python and Code Llama – Instruct, have been fine-tuned for Python code and instruction alignment respectively. The tool aims to make developer workflows more efficient and lower the barrier to entry for coding learners.

#### [Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) for Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08998v2)
![](https://cdn-thumbnails.huggingface.co/social-thumbnails/papers/2308.08998/gradient.png)

Researchers from Google DeepMind recently published the Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) method for language modeling. ReST is a novel approach that combines reinforcement learning and self-training to improve the performance of language models. The method involves training a model on a large dataset, then using the model's own predictions to generate new training data. This data is then used to further train the model, a process that is repeated iteratively. The reinforcement learning aspect comes into play by rewarding the model for making accurate predictions and penalizing it for incorrect ones. ReST can bring significant improvements to LLMs without obtaining costly human labeled data, and it's one among many recent works that hint at the promise of LLMs' self-improvement capabilities.s
